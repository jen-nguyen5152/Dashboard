    "In the previous report, it was suggested that Advance Queensland has been doing a good job in allocating funding to different sectors in Queensland to boost innovation, and commercialisation, and introduce new sectors and jobs to the market. We also know that the government has been adjusting the programs and requirements to effectively target each cohort. Since the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders is one of the priority cohorts, it is necessary to look into the delivery of these programs to this group. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Queensland is heading to hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2032, innovation is the most important thing ever. Advance Queensland is one of the government initiatives to ensure better services and infrastructures to meet the needs of the estimated large amount of tourists visiting Queensland in 2032. In the past, [Indigenous languages had been showcased in the Women’s World Cup](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/meanjin-messaging-indigenous-languages-set-to-be-spoken-at-olympic-venues-20231110-p5ej48.html) and created a great effect to help inspire and develop the value of culture and understanding of culture and shared understanding. The Brisbane 2032 Olympic games are a great opportunity to develop a better cultural understanding of the First Nation people, not only by speaking the languages but also to foster collaboration to bring the Aboriginal culture closer to everyone. The effect of the Brisbane Olympic Games increase [the tourist expenditure revenue by $12 billion](https://www.dtis.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1626448/towards-2032-reshaping-queenslands-visitor-economy.pdf), making Queensland Australia’s destination of choice for domestic and global visitors seeking the world’s best experiences. Therefore, it is the goal of the government to grow visitation to Indigenous product and experiences, which is the concept of Indigenous tourism.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This report will look into the existing Advance Queensland funding programs that support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander group and also discover other factors that the government can focus on to improve the quality of the programs in the future. In order to do that, I used a combination of structured data from the Advance Queensland dataset and unstructured data from Guardian API.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to identify appropriate terminology for our target cohort. According to the [Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies](https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/indigenous-australians-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-people), there are more than 370 million Indigenous peoples spread across 70 countries worldwide, each practising unique traditions, retaining social, cultural, economic and political characteristics that are distinct from those of the dominant societies in which they live. The term ‘Indigenous Australian’ is used to encompass both Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islander people and is used alternately in this report. Moreover, the target of Advance Queensland is not every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, but rather to focus on <b>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders</b> who are <b>business owners, innovators, researchers and students </b>. This is an important stakeholder of Advance Queensland and the focus of this report."

    "## 1. QUESTIONS\n",
    "In respect of the current tourism landscape that I mentioned, and the goals of Advance Queensland to bring innovation to their priority cohort, the most important question and its follow-up questions are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>How should the Queensland government design better programs for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cohort?</b>\n",
    "- What do the current funds for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders look like?\n",
    "- What are the aspects of the Aboriginal being discussed?\n",
    "- Are there any commercialisation opportunities for Aboriginal art and culture?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are important questions to answer because [without better preversing their art and culture, the Indigenous traditional knowledge and language will slowly disappear.](https://press.un.org/en/2019/hr5431.doc.htm). This requires careful planning and preparation to effectively protect and transmit this knowledge from one generation to the other. While the Olympic 2032 is bringing a large amount of tourists around the country and the world to Brisbane, it is likely that visitors will visit many destinations in the city and also seek more original experiences outside Brisbane. If the governments are able to support this cohort and commercialise the rich cultural heritage of Australia’s Indigenous peoples, it is a good opportunity to enhance its reach to the international market."

    "After getting the results from the API, I did some data cleaning to these unstructured data to make it easier for machine learning to get more meaningful insights. Some preprocessing I made to these documents are:\n",
    "- <b>Remove digits and special characters</b>, since they do not bring any meaning to finding the Indigenous topics.\n",
    "- <b>Tokenize</b> articles into individual words and <b>lowercasing</b> them to ensure uniformity before lemmatization. <b>Lemmatization</b> is the process of bringing words into their root meaning, such as ran=>run, cats=>cat. This will ensure words that have similar meanings are treated as one. This is a crucial step to increase the correctness of topic modelling. For example, if \"dance\" and \"dancing\" are commonly discussed when they talk about Indigenous, either one of them will not appear to be as significant as they should be, because \"dance\" and \"dancing\" are two different words even when they have very similar meaning. Lemmatization will convert both of them to \"dance\" and reflect the correct frequency of this topic.\n",
    "- One important parameter in the lemmatize function is <b>part-of-speech_tagging</b>, which is to assign a grammatical category (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence. This way, the lemmatize function can understand the syntactic structure of a sentence identify the grammatical roles of individual words and eventually gives a better result.\n",
    "- After processing every words, we join them together into a string to feed them into Vectorization.\n",
    "- One important parameter when the unstructured data is put in vectorization is `stop_words`. Although sklearn library already has a list of common stop words in English, the end result from CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer is still impacted by words such as \"police\", \"minister\", or the representative's name, or places like \"sydney\", \"melbourne\", etc. It is because news media like the Guardian generally inform the public of government decisions that may impact our lives, which is also align to the public interest. These news are not necessarily irrelevant to my question, since they can be discussing the Indigenous subject. Therefore, I customized the stop word lists so that the final result can be more relevant and accurate. I still keep \"government\" in the documents because this tells me the importance of the government in the Indigenous community and removes other similar words to avoid bias.\n",

    "In order to find out the ratio of the total amount of public money that went to the Advance Queensland fund and the Indigenous fund, I got the sum of `Actual Contractual Commitment ($)` in each data frame and divided the total of Indigenous funds to the total amount. It can be seen that very little amount of funding was offered for collaboration with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It is because the number of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islanders only accounts for 4.6% of the total population of Queensland, according to [the Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/quickstats/2021/IQS3). Therefore, it is reasonable that the amount of funding for this cohort is lower than other sectors."

       "dict_values(['The Wadawurrung elder Uncle Albert Fagan hop his great-grandchildren can one day show their kid the ancient scar tree that lie on the shore of Lake Burrumbeet , in central-western Victoria . “ I don ’ t want them to be destroy and no longer there , ” he say . Fagan , who work for the Wadawurrung Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation , be fight to preserve and rescue cultural heritage a Victoria embark on an ambitious housing expansion . He find himself on the frontline of a brewing debate over the state ’ s cultural heritage law , after the opposition on Sunday announce it would dump it support for a treaty or treaty with First Nations people , cite issue with the legislation . Related : Treaty could make people ‘ feel more divided ’ , Victorian opposition leader say , a Coalition withdraws support The Victorian opposition point to medium report in which property developer say legally require cultural heritage management plan ( CHMPs ) – which be approve by registered Aboriginal party – be hold up build project and impose excessive cost on development that be be pass on to consumer . But plan permit data provide by the Victorian government show last financial year less than % of development require a CHMP . Traditional owner group argue boost financial resourcing be need to meet increased demand to deploy field worker to assess cultural heritage include stone artefact , scar tree and fireplace , and say timeframes for assessment and approval could be reduce if developer could find option to preserve cultural heritage where it be discover . The red river gum scar tree date back to pre-colonisation but some be relocate to a property own by the Wadawurrung corporation in after they be mistakenly cut down at Lake Burrumbeet – a delicate act of salvage cultural heritage . BJ O ’ Toole , a Wadawurrung man and heritage officer at the corporation who conduct field work , say salvaging heritage be always the “ last resort ” . “ It tear my heart apart see culture destroy … we really want to try and be able to get the best outcome for the heritage because that ’ s what our old people would want , ” he say . Meeting the -day deadline The Wadawurrung corporation say despite unprecedented growth in it area of , sq km on the western side Melbourne , which include some of the nation ’ s fastest-growing area such a Geelong and Melton , it perform all of it cultural heritage evaluation within the -day deadline . The corporation acknowledge there be wait time for fieldworker to be deploy to conduct assessment on site , due to the high demand for development and workforce shortage . “ It be broadly reflective of the kind of delay that be in any business ally to construction and relate to our ability to get labour and to cope with the growth , ” say Matthew Smith , the chief executive of the corporation . Sign up for Guardian Australia ’ s free morning and afternoon email newsletter for your daily news roundup Under the state ’ s Aboriginal cultural heritage legislation , which come into effect in , register Aboriginal party have a -day deadline to approve , reject or ask for further information about a CHMP that be submit by a developer . A CHMP be require when high-impact development be plan in an area of “ cultural heritage sensitivity ” . Developers also have the option to submit a CHMP to the Department of Premier and Cabinet if the Aboriginal party can not provide an assessment within a month . The assessment and approval of the CHMP typically involve traditional owner group send fieldworker on site to evaluate what cultural heritage be present . If cultural heritage be discover on site and a development will lead to it be damage or destroy , a traditional owner group will endeavour to salvage or rescue the artefact and relocate them in an effort to preserve them , which can take month . The Eastern Maar Aboriginal Corporation say it have not receive any complaint in regard to time approve CHMPs , say it average time to send worker on site be two week . The Barengi Gadjin Land Council Aboriginal Corporation say it have complete all it assessment within the statutory deadline . Smith say the Wadawurrung corporation have double the number of employee in it fieldwork team over the past year to help meet increasing demand . It have an internal policy to hire only First Nations fieldworker to ensure it be guide by traditional owner ’ knowledge . ‘ Be innovative ’ An unnamed property expert be quote in the Herald Sun say developer face -month wait to get representative from registered Aboriginal party to visit a site . Smith say the wait time could vary from nine to month for three month ’ worth of fieldwork , to two to three month for a few day ’ worth of work . The corporation say this be partly due to cultural heritage need to be salvage or rescue and relocate when a developer decline to keep artefact preserve on the site . Smith stress that if developer be more prepared to “ be innovative ” and consider development plan that allow cultural heritage to remain intact on site and not require salvage then it wait time would reduce by a half to a third . “ For a lot of developer it will still be economically viable for them , give the cost of land , to remove that heritage and sell [ the land ] , ” he say . If there be a dispute over a CHMP , the legislation permit developer to apply to the Victorian civil and administrative tribunal for a review of the decision . Cath Evans , the Victorian executive director at the Property Council of Australia , say question about salvage or preserve heritage on site be “ complex ” and vary between site . “ Each stakeholder will have a raft of issue to take into consideration when make that decision , include the cost of salvage , the amount of land involve and it position on the site , ” she say . The council , alongside the opposition , have call for a review of Victoria ’ s cultural heritage framework . It say this should prioritise “ effective oversight of any process and delay ” . Evans say adequate resourcing of registered Aboriginal party could also be include in the scope of a review . Evans say she be not aware of situation where the -day deadline have be miss . At time , traditional owner group reach what they deem successful outcome with property developer . Fagan say in one assessment fieldworker discover a burial on a site for a propose development . They reburied it and manage to protect it by turn it into a garden and reach an agreement with the developer that the soil could not be dig up or build within a -metre radius . “ Everyone ’ s happy , ” he say . “ Everyone walk away happy and we never stop the development. ” The cost of salvage cultural heritage Property developer last week point to the cultural heritage obligation lead to unreasonable cost for building project , with some be pass on to consumer . The Herald Sun quote the residential property developer Jake Munday , who say traditional owner group be “ exploit the power provide to them ” . It reference figure of $ , “ charge ” to his construction company . Guardian Australia understand this amount be quote by an external heritage adviser to the developer for salvage and be not provide by the Wadawurrung corporation . Munday decline to comment when contact by Guardian Australia . The corporation say to date it have charge $ , for the cultural heritage management plan that be under evaluation . Guardian Australia have view invoice total this figure . The corporation confirm that the plan require no salvage a the party reach an agreement for a park to be place in the development that would allow the heritage discover – stone tool – to remain at the site . Funding and fieldworker be need While the opposition have argue that the state ’ s treaty process should not start until issue with the cultural heritage framework be resolve , traditional owner group have put forward several idea to help them meet demand and improve fieldworker availability . Eastern Maar Corporation call for the state government to consider a revised funding arrangement that align well with the “ cyclical nature of cultural heritage work ” and could be scale up or down depend on demand for work . Smith back call for boosted resourcing to help traditional owner group to be able to recruit more fieldworker and retain them , even during slower period . “ The industry be be ask to move more towards a ‘ we ’ re not go to accept any delay at all ’ standpoint , ” he say . “ However , I would suggest that Aboriginal corporation be not resourced well enough to be underwrite the risk associate with that. ” A spokesperson for the Department of Premier and Cabinet say busy period of construction and development in the state could create longer wait time for industry supply and survey , include assessment and approval require for a propose development site . “ We ’ ve undertake a range of measure to ensure potential delay in the building industry be minimise , include work closely with industry and the Aboriginal Heritage Council to identify point of concern , deliver extra resource to Registered Aboriginal Parties for Cultural Heritage Management Plan assessments , and assess some Cultural Heritage Management Plans within the department , ” the spokesperson say . The opposition ’ s spokesperson for Aboriginal affair , Peter Walsh , and the Victorian Planning Authority decline to comment when contact by Guardian Australia .', 'With six campsite up and run and a seventh about to open , the Camping with Custodians program be prove a real success story when it come to empower community on Country in Western Australia . Travellers arrive by car , camper van or motorhome to the outback campsite own and operate by Aboriginal community , and it isn ’ t just the hot shower and stun landscape that be draw people in – it ’ s the opportunity to connect with the traditional owner of the land in a meaningful way . Doon Doon campground The campground – well run , well appoint and locate in some of Western Australia ’ s most beautiful region – can be find at Djarindjin , about km north of Broome ( Rubibi ) ; Imintji , at the foot of the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges ; Violet Valley , on the bank of the Bow River ; Doon Doon , halfway between Kununurra and Purnululu National Park ; Peedamulla , on the Pilbara ’ s historic Peedamulla Station ; and Mimbi Caves , near Fitzroy Crossing and one of Australia ’ s most spectacular and significant natural geological site . A seventh campground , at Lombadina , north of Broome ( Rubibi ) , be due to open in the coming month . A place for learn The Jarlarloo Riwi campground be near the Mimbi community and Mimbi Caves , a place of great spiritual significance to the Gooniyandi people . Rosemary Nugget , Mimbi community chairperson “ The cave be use by some of my ancestor , and when I first go there and saw the rock art I get goose bump , ” say Mimbi community chairperson Rosemary Nugget . “ It be really emotional for me think back , way back , to how my people live . My great-great-great-grandfather ’ s handprint be there. ” The vividly coloured limestone cave be the remains of the Devonian Great Barrier Reef , form about m year ago . The fossilised reef be among the best preserve in the world and explore them by torchlight be an awe-inspiring adventure for young and old alike . Sharing how past generation of Gooniyandi people live be important to Nugget . She be one of a small team of Aboriginal tour guide who take campsite visitor on immersive tour through the cave . Tours begin with a walk between tower karst cliff to the first cave ’ s entrance . After a traditional smoking ceremony , visitor be introduce to some of the bush tucker and medicinal plant that the Gooniyandi people have use for thousand of year . “ The tourist love it , and they ’ re really interested in learn about it , ” Nugget say . Stories and music around the fire at the Jarlarloo Riwi campground The two-hour tour allow plenty of time to explore the cave , and for the guide to share story .

Peering out across it vast salt flat , Hazel Walgar fall silent , drinking in the beauty before our eye . “ Look at it … I ’ ve never see it like this before , ” say Walgar , a Baiyungu traditional owner who grow up on Gunjayindiya , a the station be also know . “ Wow , I ’ ve get shiver ! ” Walgar ’ s granddaughter Relisha Dingo chime in from the driver ’ s seat . “ We be take off this land but now we ’ re home , ” Walgar continue . “ I want to show people how special this place is. ” As the cultural director of Jamba Nyinayi festival , Walgar be take me on a drive across the sprawling , sq km station before the main event kick off . About a kilometre in the distance , the festival village glimmer like a mirage in the stifle mid-afternoon heat . A huddle of tent and campervans stretch out across the blush-pink dirt and the rollick thump of the sound check reverberate over the salt flat and out across the Ningaloo coast . Later in the even a lineup of acclaimed Indigenous artist will perform under the star , include the legendary songwriter Stephen Pigram , the blue and gospel singer Kankawa Nagarra and the composer and playwright David Milroy . For now , festivalgoers be embrace Jamba Nyinayi ’ s catch cry , “ rest awhile ” – meander between the beach and the station , and drink cup of tea around the cool ember of the campfire . Jamba Nyinayi represent a homecoming of sort for the Baiyungu people , who own and run the two-night cultural camping festival . For ten of thousand of year , Gunjayindiya be a meeting place for neighbour language group and the festival see the station return to it ancient root . Established in to coincide with the Dark Sky festival at the total solar eclipse , this now annual event also mark an important step for the Baiyungu people in establish their own self-sustaining cultural tourism offering . “ We sit on the doorstep of tourism , ” say Walgar , who have grand plan to build Jamba Nyinayi into a keystone annual event , as well a launch Indigenous-led whale shark swim , cultural camping in the Cape Range national park and astronomy tour . It ’ s be a long , arduous journey to get to this point . Walgar be take to Carnarvon mission at the age of six , where she be beat if she dare to speak her language . In the Baiyungu Aboriginal Corporation buy Cardabia station back and in a historic Indigenous land use agreement give Baiyungu and Thalanyji traditional owner the right to care for approximately , hectare of the Ningaloo coast . “ Here we be today , walk in the footstep of our old people and look after Ningaloo , ” she say . “ This place be a gem and no one will ever take it from us. ” Walgar work closely with the festival director , David Chitty , more than Baiyungu staff and performer , and many volunteer to present this year ’ s event . On the eve of the festival , the campfire session bring the -odd camper together for an intimate evening of music and storytelling , while feast on traditional bush food such a slow-cooked kangaroo and quandong braise . The evening and the festival at large be emcee by the cheeky and gregarious actor and comedian Ernie Dingo . A Yamatji man from the Murchison region of Western Australia , Dingo be connect to the festival through myriad family tie : Walgar ’ s husband , Gavin , be his cousin , a be the musician Fred Ryan . “ There be so many avenue of beauty to discover here , ” Dingo tell me the next morning over a cuppa . “ Souls just radiate in every direction of love , life , country , lore and language . It ’ s like a disco ball reflect the light . It ’ s beautiful to watch. ” After breakfast and a cooling dip at Bills Bay , I head for the cultural workshop . I coyly watch from the sideline at the rapper Razzy Mac ’ s hip-hop workshop and swoosh my toe in the red dirt at a choreography workshop with Janine Oxenham . In the old shearing shed , the Walmatjarri elder Kankawa Nagarra ’ s yearning , soulful drawl soar high above it rust , timeworn wall . At last year ’ s festival , Walgar instantly recognise Nagarra : she be Walgar ’ s “ mission mum ” at Carnarvon , offer love and care to six-year-old Walgar , who have be violently remove from her family . They hadn ’ t see each other in year . “ Everyone be cry , ” Chitty say . “ It ’ s incredible that through the art and through a festival like this , we can bring people together from different region who lose one another. ” As the sun start to set on the festival ’ s second night , we gather around the main stage , eagerly await it finale . It ’ s a sticky C at pm and the fly be persist but the crowd be in good spirit – swell to about , people a more camper and local join the festivity . A four-hour lineup of music ensues , fill with so many toe-tapping hit and virtuosic performer , I ’ m reluctant to leave my seat . But the evening ’ s most affecting moment come when Pigram sing his hit Nowhere Else But Here . “ I like to tell people we ’ re about a far west a you can get – in this western belly of the land , ” he say . There ’ s a palpable sense of concord among the audience when Pigram sing the song ’ s final lyric : “ If there be one place we ’ re all free to be , it ’ s nowhere else but here. ” Related : ‘ A revolutionary moment ’ : what ’ s the future for Indigenous Australian dance ? Dingo take to the stage again and , in a rare sombre moment , ask u to find our ancestor in the star : “ Even the one we ’ ve let fade away .

But it ’ s impossible not to feel some kind of cosmic presence in this mighty prehistoric land , where the desert meet the sea . As the revelry concludes and I head back to my tent , something Walgar say earlier come back to me . “ My old people be all go now , ” she say . “ But I strongly feel I ’ m fulfil their vision for this place .

It would draw on his Kamilaroi , Bigambul , British and Scottish heritage and present his family story a a distillation of Australia ’ s -year colonial history . Moore , who be bear in Toowoomba in to a mother of Bigambul and Kamilaroi lineage and a father of British and Scottish heritage , be perhaps best know for installation draw on his personal history and childhood memory . They often use scent , sound and recreated space – most famously , his childhood home in Tara , western Queensland , and his grandmother ’ s hut in Glenmorgan – to immerse viewer in his experience . “ I ’ m kind of interested in that impossibility of know or understand another , [ even ] if we have the share experience , ” he tell Guardian Australia on Thursday . “ So [ I use immersive installation ] a a way to say , ‘ Will Indigenous and non-Indigenous people know and understand each other ? ’ ” Although it have be a frequent motif across his three-decade body of work , Moore only start seriously investigate his family history four year ago .

The web of story he uncover include a great-great-grandfather who be transport to New South Wales a a convict , whose descendant ( Moore ’ s grandfather ) win a parcel of land in Queensland ’ s land ballot – land that belong to Moore ’ s Kamilaroi ancestor . In kith and kin , this expansive personal history will fuse with his more explicitly political ongoing concern such a national identity and state control . He say he will be “ present ” at the Biennale rather than “ represent ” , a he doesn ’ t see himself a speak on behalf of anyone other than himself . “ [ I hope viewer come away with ] a bit more of an understanding of Indigenous Australians , because I ’ m not sure how much they know about Indigenous Australia , or the history , or what kind of circumstance we ’ re living in. ” At the Thursday event hold at Moore ’ s Marrickville gallery , the Commercial , he and the curator Ellie Buttrose be tight-lipped about detail of the exhibition . “ Archie ’ s make a lot of work [ over his career ] that refer to his family and also the memory of his family – and this exhibition will be no different , ” Buttrose say .

I felt shame when I be younger , embarrass … I didn ’ t talk . I try to be invisible . So that mean a lot of time at home in my room , draw and read magazines. ” Becoming an artist be , he say , be an inevitability . He want to call his project “ kith and kin ” from the beginning of the proposal process . The title play on the original Old English usage of the term , which refer ( respectively ) to countryman , or “ one ’ s own land ” , and family member . For Moore , this antiquated English meaning resembles “ Indigenous way of think about the land ” . “ The land be part of the kinship system ; it could also be a teacher or mentor , or parent to a child .

But it ’ s also get the internal combustion engine : the plan to revive some element of the stage-three flat tax plan that benefit the rich . In his grouchy interview on ABC ’ s . this week and around the trap in Canberra , opposition leader Peter Dutton look like a very reluctant hybrid driver . The Coalition backflip to wave through Labor ’ s tax change be seal on Tuesday with an air of “ let ’ s get this over with ” .

The Nationals leader , David Littleproud , say we should “ pause ” the rollout of large-scale renewables because tear up agricultural land be “ pure insanity ” ; and be support by former leader Barnaby Joyce ’ s complaint about the cost of transmission . Both claim be exaggerated . The shadow climate and energy minister , Ted O ’ Brien , busy himself online shop for new car .

Dutton be ever the Queensland cop and want to weigh in . It be the first topic in his usual radio pow-wow with Ray Hadley on Thursday , give him clear air to argue it be “ not just Queenslanders but a lot of Australians who be face this crime endemic – they want a leader who can stand up ” . The Coalition lent in again during question time : the first question be to Mark Dreyfus about plan to raise the age of criminal responsibility . So here we have a party leader at a protest , a well-advanced stop in a byelection campaign and a pre-vetted question in parliament .

To do so , he be prepared to whip up hip-pocket scare campaign and cultural war issue to signal that inner-city lefty like Albanese and Plibersek be not like the average marginal-seat voter .

The motivation be to “ protect ” innocent child from “ sexualisation ” . That part of the city be devoutly religious and family-friendly , the council declare ; the implication be that anyone queer must be pervert , sinful , commit to the destruction of the family unit , and somehow prey on child .

Of course , a we ’ ve learn this week , these attitude aren ’ t confine to regional and rural Australia .

Established in by two young woman , Joc Curran and C Smith , it ’ s still emerge from a difficult period after Curran sell the venue in . “ I ’ d give it year of my life , and I need to have a life outside of that , ” she say . Since then it ’ s go through a couple of set of hand . Pixie Weyand buy The Zoo from Curran and , with the latter ’ s help , stag a th anniversary celebration in late . But the Covid pandemic wrought devastation , despite Brisbane initially escape almost unscathed : in the city play host to a packed AFL grand final , normally hold in Melbourne .

Downstairs , what use to be the shop Tym ’ s Guitars serve a a green room for international artist . The Zoo itself stand at the top of a flight of stair in a decaying building on Ann Street , in the heart of the city ’ s nightclub precinct , Fortitude Valley . Among other thing , the -capacity room be once famous for it lack of air-conditioning , turn packed gig into a giant subtropical sauna during Brisbane ’ s famously steamy summer . That ’ s be fix now . But , even in the old day , the venue be an oasis for music lover – and an escape from the madness that have long permeate the Valley . When it open it door , Brisbane be still emerge , blink , from the corruption and vice preside over by the infamous former premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen . Fortitude Valley have be rule by a vicious alliance of criminal and crooked cop who run a protection racket they codenamed The Joke . The Fitzgerald inquiry destroy them , along with Bjelke-Petersen ’ s government . Along with the recession of the early s it turn the old red-light district into a wasteland . Practically every shopfront be for lease . For Curran and Smith , it be the only affordable place to realise their dream . Initially they intend the space to be a cafe-gallery , where local artist could get some exposure .

In this seedy part of town , The Zoo become a safe space : for woman , for the LGBTQ+ community and for bud artist of all stripe . An unofficial “ no dickhead ” policy be subtly enforce . “ We never sell double shot and we never sell rum , ” Curran say . “ If you come to The Zoo , you respect the rules. ” Eventually , it help transform the Valley , and Brisbane too , nurture many of the artist who dominate Australian music in the s : Powderfinger , Regurgitator , Screamfeeder and others . Robert Forster of the Go-Betweens have say that nothing else do as much for Brisbane ’ s music scene during that period . The venue would go on to host many more celebrated show . Forster join force with his old songwriting partner , the late Grant McLennan , to form a new lineup of the Go-Betweens which first play The Zoo in December . A month later , Nick Cave jump up on stage with the Dirty Three – the beginning of his work relationship with Warren Ellis . The Zoo also host the famously fractious Pixies , who play one overflow night in . Curran remember only good vibe : “ It be just Pixies and myself in the room and they do a two-hour soundcheck . They hadn ’ t see each other for a year and they be laugh and joking and relaxed . I just felt like I be in heaven. ” The Zoo be now attempt to diversify , with booking outsource to the Melbourne-based agency Calibre Music Management . There be still plenty of rock , punk and metal show , but K-pop too . “ It ’ s just good business sense to try and have as many touch point with the community a possible , ” say a Calibre director , Nathan Farrell . Farrell say the venue be rebound , claim that more ticket be sell in than any year in The Zoo ’ s history . But that doesn ’ t mean it ’ s out of the wood : in a cost-of-living crisis , get people through the door be only half the battle . “ We ’ re find all our venue be report that spend-per-heads be down on sold-out nights. ” There ’ s also the issue of skyrocket public liability insurance , call out by the Melbourne venue Sooki Lounge . Chidgzey say The Zoo ’ s bill rise from $ , in to $ , the following year and now $ , this year , despite there be only one claim in the venue ’ s history . It help that Brisbane ’ s grassroots scene be thrive : Farrell say he handle up to more young act there than in Melbourne .

Without say I didn ’ t miss Sydney , which be true , I keep my response simple : “ Brisbane be my home now. ” The landscape , the ecosystem , the light all capture the sens of many Brisbane writer When I read Sally Piper ’ s novel Bone Memories , I saw some of my reasoning in the line : “ This place have all the goings-on of another kind of city , pulse with as much activity a the one she ’ d leave behind. ” That activity be certainly in the art but also in the weather pattern that be so new and extreme to me . I remember the fierceness of the first electrical storm the summer I arrive ; be amuse by colleague analyse the BoM site on their work computer , calculate how much time they have to get safely home . The devastating effect of flood aside , I be still mesmerise by lightning flash across a green-grey sky , and the often sideways rain during Brisbane ’ s tropical summer storm .

Dr Anita Heiss be an avid runner and author of Tiddas , a love letter to Brisbane', 'Australia be build an air traffic control system for drone a authority prepare for a surge in uncrewed aircraft flight and fly taxi over the next decade . Airservices Australia – the federal government agency responsible for manage airspace across the country – have appoint air traffic management company Frequentis Australasia to develop a “ digital air traffic management to safely integrate million of uncrewed aircraft flight into Australia ’ s busy airspace ” .

Analysis commission by Airservices Australia predict that drone flight in the country will surge to m by include delivery drone , air taxi and other pilotless operation . At present , there be about .m drone flight a year . “ The way we do air traffic control today win ’ t work for the number of drone we expect to see in our sky , ” Airservices Australia ’ s Luke Gumley say on Monday . “ There will be many aircraft in urban environment with high population … drone delivery will operate in populous area . Gumley , the head of transformation uncrewed service , say the future drone management system would incorporate a significant amount of automation . Current air traffic control system rely on verbal communication between controller and pilot . Authorities be expect unmanned aircraft to be highly automate , possibly with one pilot on the ground control multiple aircraft at once , he say . “ Humans will still be in the loop , but perhaps more on the loop than within the loop. ” Ultimately , the drone management system would have to integrate with the broader control of air traffic in Australia , to ensure drone didn ’ t interfere with commercial flight and to stop them from crash into each other , Gumley say . “ Currently , drone generally don ’ t operate where crewed aircraft do , but in time we know we ’ ll have to integrate the two , with airspace be finite , and congestion around urban environment , ” he say . Related : Your electric fly taxi be just around the corner “ We will have to have strong coordination … with system talk to each other. ” Australia would examine US and European Union drone management so local system be interoperable with international standard , Gumley say . New rule would focus on commercial operation such a drone and air taxi a oppose to smaller consumer and photography drone , but Gumley predict that in particularly busy urban area “ we might need recreational [ drone ] pilot to take some additional step to fly ” . While an “ influx of drone ” be expect first , fly taxi would soon become prominent in Australian sky , Airservices Australia ’ s recent analysis find . “ We see that the Brisbane Olympic Games will be a catalysing event for air taxi , ” Gumley say . “ We know that from speak to air taxi manufacturer – they ’ re hop to deliver some service at the Brisbane Olympics and we see air taxi operate more at scale by then. ” Airservices Australia believe the first wave of air taxi will have pilot onboard but say it be aware of some company hop to launch with uncrewed operation – so the agency be plan a management system that could handle both . “ We ’ re prepare our technology to cater for both type of air taxi , ” Gumley say . Given the robust nature of aviation safety standard , Gumley say , artificial intelligence would not feature a part of the initial drone airspace management system .

Vikash Raniga If they arrive early , Beyond member ( and Virgin Frequent Flyer member with Gold status or above ) may be eligible to take advantage of Virgin Australia ’ s Fly Ahead service and jump on an earlier flight to get a head start on their day . . Stay active Walk when you can . “ I walk whenever possible , even in the airport terminal in Brisbane , ” Raniga say . “ If I get to the airport early and I don ’ t have anything press work-wise , once I ’ ve settle in the lounge , I just go for a walk in the terminal – probably only a thousand step , but every bit helps. “ And then once I get to the other end , rather than jump on transport , I like to walk , especially after lunch and dinner. ” Setting up meeting outside the office can give you time to get up and move between commitment , and can be a good way to see your destination .

This can mean a busy schedule of breakfast , meeting outside typical office hour and work dinner . “ You hear of prime minister or CEOs who can get by with three or four hour ’ sleep , ” Raniga say . “ I can ’ t . I need my seven to eight hour daily . I can get by on le for one , maybe two night , but that will be about my max .

Here ’ s what we know so far . What do we learn about FMIA in this year ’ s budget ? A lot . A six-page “ fact sheet ” and “ glossy ” overview brochure lay bare the budget ’ s intent to deliver “ Cost of live help & amp ; a future make in Australia ” . The ambition look grand with $ .bn earmark over the next decade . Large chunk will be spend a production subsidy , such a $ .bn for hydrogen produce with renewable energy and $ bn for refining and processing critical mineral . That spending mimic the tax credit offer by the much larger Inflation Reduction Act ( $ Abn and count ) in the US . Given their nascent state – particularly when it come to green hydrogen – the spending will take a few year to ramp up . The opposition treasury spokesman , Angus Taylor , have also flag the Coalition would axe the “ billion to billionaire ” scheme if it get the chance before the money flow . Budget paper No justify the government backing of private project like this : “ In certain circumstance , target public investment can strengthen the alignment of economic incentive with Australia ’ s national interest and incentivise private investment at scale to develop priority industries. ” If Australia pull it off , the country will “ be an indispensable part of the global economy ” , another budget publication state . Presumably , these industry may fill the void if coal and gas export diminish – a they must if the world get serious about climate action . Some of the spending be “ enable ” . There ’ ll be a “ new front door ” to streamline investment and planning approval , that have be welcome by group such the Investor Group on Climate Change . A $ .bn innovation fund , $ .m to boost worker ’ skill and a -year extension of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency will also aid the country ’ s ambition to become a “ renewable energy superpower ” . Also bundle into the mix be regional support such a the $ .m Future Drought Fund over eight year . Perhaps that ’ s a nod to the future of a more volatile global climate that a one of the world ’ s largest fossil fuel export Australia have help to make . What other project be include in FMIA ? What count a a FMIA project be not entirely clear before Tuesday ’ s budget . For instance , the $ bn National Reconstruction Fund , which be yet to approve any project , will be part of the “ whole package ” even if not all of it seven priority neatly fit the bill . The $ bn Solar Sunshot , announce in the Hunter at the end of March , count a one , a do the $ m in loan to Alpha HPA to deliver “ Australia ’ s first high-purity alumina processing facility in Queensland ” . So , too , do the $ m earmark for Renascor Resources to develop a graphite mine in South Australia ’ s Eyre Peninsula . The $ m investment in PsiQuantum to “ build the world ’ s first fault-tolerant quantum computer in Brisbane ” be the largest single FMIA foray . Others be not so clear . In April , Bowen dub the $ m for nine industrial project a “ ensure a future make in Australia ” , although that money come from the $ .bn Powering Our Regions fund . The $ bn Hydrogen Headstart program , announce in last year ’ s budget , have also be add to the mix . “ Clean , cheap renewable hydrogen be a vital part of a future make in Australia , ” Bowen say this month . In case the public think FMIA be only about fight climate change , the $ bn deal with Germany ’ s Rheinmetall to build Boxer weapon carrier for export be also count . The pact be foreshadow in July last year , well before FMIA emerge , and the - budget list $ .m over seven year a the subsidy cost . When do we first hear about the policy ? A future make in Australia be hardly an unusual collection of word so it ’ s not surprising Anthony Albanese use such a combination year ago . In January , month before become prime minister , he visit the Hunter Valley in New South Wales . “ In everything from infrastructure and manufacturing to energy and innovation , we will champion a future make in Australia , ” he say . The PM visit the Hunter again on March this year to formally launch the policy , with it clear decarbonisation theme : “ I want a future make in Australia . And I want a future make in our region . We have every metal and critical mineral necessary to be a central player in the net zero transformation and a proven track record a a reliable energy producer and exporter. ” The policy get a fuller air two week later at the Queensland Press Club , include the announcement of a Future Made in Australia Act “ to anchor this reform and secure this growth ” . “ We will bring together in a comprehensive and coordinated way a whole package of new and exist initiative , ” the PM say of the act . What be in the FMIA Act ? No one know , a detail of the bill aren ’ t public yet and it look unlikely to meet the government ’ s original July target date for pass parliament . Expect it to focus on make Australia a renewable energy superpower and at least process more of the country ’ s resource so they don ’ t exit these shore “ raw ” . The net zero carbon transformation be one main organise theme , with economic resilience and security the other one . Australian worker and business be intend to be the beneficiary , the government say – emphasise one or the other , depend on the audience . FMIA ’ s wide-ranging scope mean it win ’ t sit within a single minister ’ s portfolio . Instead , the PM will lead collaboration with the treasurer , Jim Chalmers , the finance minister , Katy Gallagher , the energy minister , Chris Bowen , the industry minister , Ed Husic , and the resource minister , Madeleine King .', 'We call it the national game , but only half of Australia play or support the code of AFL – it ’ s a if we can ’ t even agree on the very basic . And while it seem an unlikely subject for theatre , there have be some terrific play write about footy : Alan Hopgood ’ s And the Big Men Fly , David Williamson ’ s The Club and , more recently , Brendan Cowell ’ s The Sublime . We can add Trawlwoolway playwright Nathan Maynard ’ s to the list . The number belong to Swans legend and former Australian of the Year Adam Goodes . His legacy – and the controversy with which his career come to be associate – penetrates every sinew of this work . It employ the concept of the synecdoche , where a part stand in for the whole , to explore theme of unity , identity and racism . The part be the local team of a small coastal town , the Currawongs ; the whole , quite clearly , be the country itself . Related : ‘ A revolutionary moment ’ : what ’ s the future for Indigenous Australian dance ? The Currawongs have have a rough trot , have never win a premiership in their history , but this year they reckon they can smell victory in the air . They ’ ve just recruit two Aboriginal kid , Sonny ( Tibian Wyles ) and Jayma ( Ngali Shaw ) , and for a while at least , the team embrace them and see a massive improvement in it performance . But this be the era of Goodes , whose on-field behaviour – call out racist taunt from the crowd , adopt warrior stance and mime the throwing of a spear – expose division lie just under the surface . Jayma , in particular , feel the heat of this controversy , and be isolate when he speak up in Goodes ’ s defence . Maynard ’ s script be robust and persuasive , content for a time to luxuriate in the hypermasculinity it then go on to interrogate . The opening scene burst with locker-room profanity , with the kind of performative braggadocio that seem innate not just to footy but to all competitive sport . The team ’ s coach , know a the General ( Syd Brisbane ) , talk of pay a price for victory , but it become clear that the price be higher for those who have already pay far more than their share . White hypocrisy , white guilt and flat-out white supremacy smother these Black kid until they struggle to breathe . When they push back , they ’ re immediately ostracise .

Sonny and Jayma draw on thousand of year of dance history to carve out routine of immense power , but the entire cast move with precision and intent . The actual game play be thrill , abstract but also richly evocative of footy at it balletic best . Bodies pulse and shove and fly into the heaven . Performances be vigorous and finely wrought , humanise character that could easily become utterly unpalatable . Maynard ’ s script tends to reduce some part to mouthpiece , simplistic line of argument rather than complex and contradictory human being – an issue that plague Williamson ’ s work too – but the cast round them out nicely . Shaw be magnificent a the play ’ s lightning rod and voice of integrity , variously jocular and wary ; he ’ s jittery at rest but lithe and expansive in action . There be a great atmosphere of nobility about him , an emergent authority . He ’ s support admirably by Wyles , who bring a weariness and sense of resignation to Sonny that speaks of generational trauma , but also of pragmatism . Ben O ’ Toole make much of the conflicted captain , and Eddie Orton be chill a the play ’ s chief villain , supremely entitle and secure . Dale Ferguson ’ s set , a simple locker room that effortlessly suggest the backstage sweat and swagger of community footy , be brilliantly effective – it feel capable of capture the quotidian nature of country sport as well a the flicker of greatness find in any premiership game . Ben Hughes ’ s light design be supple and responsive , and James Henry ’ s sound composition be compel . The technical aspect of the play be deeply consider and integrate , a testament to Drandic ’ s singular vision . be something of a wake-up call after the hugely disappointing Indigenous voice to parliament debate . Goodes leave the AFL in disgust in , and more and more Indigenous player be allege that the AFL fail to protect them from racist abuse and discrimination while they play for team that so thoroughly benefit from their athleticism and skill . Maynard ’ s play throw a disturb spotlight on the way in which this country profit from Indigenous culture – footy itself be largely influence by the First Nations ’ game of Marn Grook – without give back in return . If we ’ re a team , this sharp and formidable play asks , why doesn ’ t everyone feel like play ? Melbourne Theatre Company ’ s be on at The Sumner theatre until April', 'Curator Hetti Perkins once describe Judy Watson ’ s work a a “ tender trap ” , for it “ seductive beauty ” and ability to transmit powerful , often painful message . This be in full evidence at Queensland Art Gallery ( QAG ) , which be showcasing four decade of practice across more than work by the Mundubbera-born , Meeanjin/Magandjin/Brisbane-based artist . It be the most expansive survey of Watson ’ s work to date . Even the exhibition ’ s title , mudunama kundana wandaraba jarribirri , have a poetic beauty that belie it bite : in the language of Watsons ’ Waanyi ancestor , it translate a “ tomorrow the tree grow stronger ” . The line be take from a poem by her son , Otis Carmichael : “ now the tree be cut . tomorrow the tree grow stronger , fight the axe that cut it . our people bite back. ” Visitors ’ first encounter with the exhibition be a striking installation just past the gallery ’ s entrance : a curving red gash , like a smile , paint on a white floor plinth , with a heavy pour of white salt down it centre . At the back , form a kind of hang windbreak , be thicket of cut branch . The afternoon before the opening , visitor keep pause to admire the arrangement . Titled salt in the wound , it allude to an episode in which Watson ’ s great-great-grandmother Rosie escape a massacre of Waanyi by the Native Police at Lawn Hill Station in north-west Queensland when she be a young woman – a story pass down matrilineally , until Watson hear it from her grandmother Grace . Sign up for our rundown of must-reads , pop culture and tip for the weekend , every Saturday morning The gash , paint in red ochre , represent the bayonet wound Rosie receive while hide in a windbreak with another girl . The two roll down the hill and hid in a waterway , submerge themselves fully by put rock on their belly and use hollow reed a breathe tube . Rosie carry the bayonet wind the rest of her life , and Watson have say the ochre gash in her installation “ be the open wound with the salt in it , which come down through generation . A trans-generational trauma throughout history and our families. ” Previous presentation of the work have incorporate an installation of pair of wax-cast ear , nail to the gallery wall – a grisly reminder of documented colonial violence in the same location . At QAG , this installation be tuck away within the main gallery space , a truth bomb ready to detonate a the viewer round the corner . On the wall behind salt in the wound , score of small bronze-cast stone be arrange in the shape of the continent . The stone be originally show – in a different configuration – a part of the landmark Australian exhibition for the Venice Biennale . At QAG , the stone form a “ partial massacre map ” documenting site at which Australia ’ s First Peoples be massacre by colonist . “ Not all of them , because I didn ’ t have enough bronze stone , ” say Watson . A list of site can be find in Watson ’ s video the name of place , also part of the exhibition . Watson be relax and unfussy when talk about her work , and regularly namechecks other artist who have contribute to various piece , a collaborator or studio assistant , and praise the installation team . She point out a slick of water on the ochre in salt in the wound , and marvel : “ I ’ ve never have this happen before ; this time , the salt start weeping. ” Somehow , magnesium salt have contaminate the regular salt generally use for the work – but she seem pleased . Related : Venice Biennale : Australian pavilion to explore colonisation , incarceration and First Nations resilience “ I might use it again – it add another element to it , ” she say . “ As an artist you control certain thing and there ’ s other thing you can ’ t control . And that ’ s what I love. ” There ’ s something of the alchemist in Watson , who come to art via printmaking in the late s , at the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education in Toowoomba , and study lithography ( a method of printmaking reliant on chemistry ) at University of Tasmania , then Monash University in Gippsland , Victoria . The canvas for which she be perhaps best know owe much of their colour , texture and patterning to chemical reaction – plan and unplanned . Watson often use indigo ( which she fell in love with during a residency in Italy ) and shibori , a technique involve the folding and tying of fabric to affect dye pattern , which she pick up from her younger sister , who study textile production . “ I just remember see the fabric go into the indigo dye , and a it come out it turn green , and then it suddenly change a it oxidise and go blue , ” Watson say . “ It often seem to be the thing that change that I respond to. ” Lithography profoundly influence her practice in other way , too : she put her love of collaboration down to the atmosphere and process of the printmaking studio , and have describe draw a the source of all of her work . In her series our hair in your collection , our bone in your collection and our skin in your collection ( all feature in the exhibition ) she “ artistically repatriate ” Waanyi item hold in the British Museum by trace their outline . Visitors will notice recurrent motif across Watson ’ s print on paper and canvas work , include string and rope , leaf and grass , spine ( of plant , fish or spear ) , and the shape of shield , termite mound and dilly bag – all draw on Waanyi Country and culture . Likewise , a show-stopping installation in the gallery ’ s central water mall feature a congregation of bronze-cast form resemble termite mound , fish trap and upended dilly bag . Watson say a return trip to her ancestral Country , Boodjamulla ( Lawn Hill ) Gorge national park , in with her family , profoundly shape her art practice : “ My uncle Ken Isaacson show me : down on the ground there be stone tool scatter ; in the side of the gorge be rock engraving and painting . There be important site all through there . So I ’ ve make a lot of work [ about the idea ] of look at the ground , or learn from the ground up. ” The exhibition , preside over by Katina Davidson ( Kullilli/Yuggera ) , the gallery ’ s curator of Indigenous Australian art , be organise around four theme that encompass Watson ’ s key ongoing concern : identity , the archive , feminism and environmentalism . In conversation , Watson be unambiguous and emphatic on these topic . In her art , she be more subtle . Her idea often permeate the viewer ’ s consciousness slowly : you might be draw to a work ’ s beauty or strike aesthetic from afar , and only catch the detail and layer of mean upon closer examination . I ask Watson if she have ever be tempt by other form of advocacy , and she smile : “ There ’ s lot of other way to do it . But there ’ s something about work with the body – channel it through my body – that feel good , too . And it ’ s not that people will understand thing straight away . But that ’ s all right . I don ’ t understand lot of thing straight away either … and what I don ’ t understand I think be most interesting , and take me on a different journey. ” Judy Watson ’ s exhibition mudunama kundana wandaraba jarribirri be on at Queensland Art Gallery until August . Admission be free', 'Last month the internet light up with photo of Australians wear a colourful new range of hoodies , track pant , slide and beany .

But at a time when trust in our supermarket be dwindle , Aldi have maintain a unique cult follow in Australia . Debbie Berger , a Brisbane member of one of the Aldi fan group on Facebook , say she be convert to the supermarket chain after move in with her partner , a -year-old truckie who “ would marry Aldi ” if he could . Now she enjoy scour her local store ’ s famed middle aisle , where she have pick up everything from a bike seat to a lemon tree . The price be , she say , “ much cheaper ” than elsewhere . But there ’ s another reason she keep go back – it ’ s just a less overwhelming place to do your grocery . “ You go there and need dried apricot , there ’ s just one packet of dried apricot , ” Berger say . “ You don ’ t need to look at different brand and decide. ” If you can get customer to really like your home brand Aldi coffee , that ’ s the only place you can get that product … Customers become loyal to you Louise Grimmer Fellow Aldi fan Angela Murray-Gilbert , also from Brisbane , agree that in addition to the saving , it ’ s quicker to get her grocery do at Aldi . Friends and family call her “ Queen Aldi ” for her deep love of the supermarket . “ I do feel like Aldi speak to me because I can say I need something and within the next two catalogue , that be their special buy . It may not be an act of God , but it give u something to giggle about , ” she say . Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads , pop culture and tip for the weekend , every Saturday morning Aldi ’ s success be measurable by several metric : since enter the Australian market in with two Sydney store , the chain have grow to almost location in every state and territory bar Tasmania and the Northern Territory . It have be name Canstar Blue ’ s most trusted Australian grocery brand for six year run and Roy Morgan ’ s supermarket of the year for the last four , and have pip IGA to become the grocery retailer with the third-largest market share . It regularly top consumer advocacy group Choice ’ s supermarket product comparison , and score favourably in Guardian Australia ’ s own . Even if you ’ ve never shop at Aldi yourself , you ’ ve likely still benefit from it . Jason Murphy , an economist who write regularly about supermarket , say the arrival of the German grocer prompt Coles and Woolworths to start battling over price and shore up their image on affordability . And a a multinational corporation , Aldi be a competitor that can ’ t be buy out by the Australian grocery giant – unlike Bi-Lo and Franklins , which be buy by Coles and Metcash respectively . So how do Aldi get so big in Australia ? “ We ’ ve definitely find that Aldi consistently come out on top for value , ” say Pru Engel from consumer advocacy group Choice , which regularly compare Australian supermarket product . Engel say Aldi also often score higher than competitor in quality of package food product and clean supply . “ So not only be they cheaper , they ’ re good performer a well. ” There be some caveat to Choice ’ s advice . The TVs sometimes sell by Aldi “ consistently receive really average score ” , Engel say , and the branded product stock by Aldi , such a Nutella or Vegemite , be not necessarily cheaper than at Coles or Woolworths . How Aldi manage to offer lower price be all part of it business plan . Key to the cheaper shop be that a report % of Aldi ’ s stock be it own branded product , which be “ always much cheaper for supermarket ” , say Louise Grimmer , a senior lecturer at the University of Tasmania who specialise in retail marketing . Related : What ’ s to fight over in the Aldi middle aisle this week – chainsaw or wicker chair ? | Deirdre Fidge Those product be less costly to sell simply because there ’ s no need to spend money advertise them – a big line item in the production of , say , Coca-Cola . And create great-tasting own-brand product be a clever way to keep shopper come back to Aldi , Grimmer add . “ If you can get customer to really like your home brand Aldi coffee , that ’ s the only place you can get that product . So … customer become loyal to you , ” she say . Shoppers might not necessarily realise that most of the product in store be make by Aldi . They ’ re typically give brand name , and the packaging might resemble popular local brand – Aldi might sell a packet of flour that look a lot like White Wings , for instance , but call it White Mill . Murphy say beyond it own-brand product , the chain be also cheaper because “ they run a much tighter ship ” than the big two . “ It ’ s just a really small footprint shop and they stock way fewer item – they have like , different thing in the shop instead of , . So that reduce complexity in their operation and in the amount of warehouse space they need . And they ’ ve get a global supply chain as well , which really help – they ’ re selling similar thing in Aldis all over the world , ” Murphy say . Anyone who remember the Australian farmer who get screw in the Coles and Woolworths battle over dollar milk might wonder if there ’ s someone else down the supply chain pay the true price for Aldi ’ s bargain grocery . But Murphy say that as far a he know , the chain ’ s low price do not come at anyone ’ s expense . “ Rather than do spot pricing and buying thing at variable price that make life difficult for their supplier , they sign these long-term contract and they try to really build a good relationship . And you ’ ll often hear supplier talk about how much nicer it be to work for Aldi than for the big two , ” Murphy say . Then there ’ s the middle aisle . Those idiosyncratic special buy , Grimmer say , be “ a really clever idea to get people come into the store each week ” and another huge puzzle piece in the story of Aldi ’ s success . Stock be different every week , availability be limit , and part of the fun be “ treasure hunting and find a bargain ” . Grimmer note that not every shopper love Aldi . Some find the prospect of do their grocery next to pile of discount camp gear or luggage “ not a particularly appeal prospect ” ; others don ’ t “ equate Aldi with really fresh fruit and vegetable ” . “ A lot of people like their nationally brand product , and say Aldi just don ’ t have the range that I ’ m look for in term of sort of the breadth and depth of different product category , ” she add . “ I think you either love or hate Aldi , don ’ t you ? There ’ s no in-between. ” But for those who do love it , Grimmer believe another factor in Aldi ’ s success in Australia be that compare with the rest of the world , “ we have really boring supermarket ” . The UK have Sainsbury ’ s , Waitrose , Tesco and Morrisons , as well a the discount Germain chain . The US have Trader Joe ’ s , Whole Foods Market and HEB , among a laundry list of others . But Australia ’ s grocery landscape be dominate by Coles and Woolworths , “ which be just carbon copy of each other ” , she say . And we ’ re desperate for something – anything – else . “ If it wasn ’ t Aldi , it might have be another brand . And they may well have be as popular a well , just because they ’ re a third choice , ” Grimmer say . “ We just don ’ t have a lot of choice here in Australia . ”', 'Stretching across almost , sq km and with an age that ’ s measure in billion of year , Western Australia ’ s Kimberley region be the definition of grand .

His labyrinthine novel take the reader on wild ride a disparate thread collide in surprising , sometimes unhinged way . When I imagine him write them , I picture the meme of Charlie Day , maniacally connect thought together with string on a board . “ The meme be accurate , ” Lu say , deadpan . Lu stand out in the often staid Australian literary world for his work ’ s originality and it audacity , use absurdist humour to explore race and racism . There be his two novel – ’ s award-winning The Whitewash , a satirical oral history of a Hollywood blockbuster go wrong ; and the upcoming Ghost Cities , a dual narrative set in an abandon Chinese megacity . There be also The Beige Index , an online project in which Lu and fellow writer Jonathan O ’ Brien watch every one of IMDb ’ s top film and create visual chart of the actor ’ ethnicity . And there be what Lu call Silly Bookstagram , where he Photoshops his name on to Australian book cover . “ I think a lot about ontological whiteness – where you default a character , if not otherwise specify , a white . I be guilty of it for a really long time in my reading and my writing , ” Lu say . “ I ’ ve get a dumb , goofy sense of humour … It ’ s % ridiculous , but there be % of it that be incredibly serious . It make you think about how overwhelmingly white the publishing industry be , when I ’ m insert myself a the sole Asian element in a book … That goofy energy be the same thing that drive The Beige Index , The Whitewash and Ghost Cities. ” These work be Lu ’ s way of fill in the gap . Born in Malaysia and raise in Brisbane , he be an “ emotional latchkey kid ” . “ My parent be very attentive to what they think I need : a good education , excel in musical instrument , go to church , ” he say . “ It be leave to me to figure out who the fuck I be in term of culture . Movies , TV show , book , music – the stuff you fill your head with to figure out who you are. ” Related : Critics , cancellation and cleanskin wine : the Australian novel satirise the art world Like many people of colour grow up in the s , Lu didn ’ t see himself in any of that – but in a time before discussion about representation be common , it be difficult to articulate the issue . “ It ’ s really hard to identify the thing that ’ s miss , ” he say . “ It take a really long time , unless the culture be tune to it , to even notice that something ’ s off .

That really impact who I be and who I want to be. ” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads , pop culture and tip for the weekend , every Saturday morning The world have increasingly embrace diversity , but with that , another challenge have appear : for creatives of colour , this suppose freedom can be limit . “ It ’ s a Pandora ’ s box , because there be good , but there ’ s a ton of bad that come along with it , ” Lu say . “ It ’ s another box to put the ethnic writer in … I ’ ve speak with Asian writer who feel box in by this pressure to write Asian stories. ” Lu ’ s loop narrative feel like a middle finger to that expectation . Voices clash and crash over one another ; narrator be unreliable ; fact and fiction be often indistinguishable . “ I ’ m attract to subversion , ” he say . “ It ’ s like a mountain – you see the mountain and you realise that nobody ’ s try to climb that particular mountain . Maybe that ’ s because it ’ s an extremely esoteric , shitty mountain that nobody ’ s ever think about . I see the summit from here , and nobody ’ s claim that , and that really excite me. ” Ghost Cities be one such mountain . The novel combine two timeline : one in the present where a young man , Xiang Lu , be fire from his job at Sydney ’ s Chinese consulate when it be discover that he can ’ t speak Chinese and have be use Google Translate for his work . The other be in the ancient past , tell through fable-like chapter . The thread collide when Xiang and his interpreter ( and love interest ) Yuan be whisk across the world by Baby Bao , a director who be make a film base on Chinese myth in the abandoned city of Port Man Tou , which have be turn into a film set . The seed for the book be sow when Lu and his wife , Yuan , visit an abandoned theme park on the outskirt of Beijing – an “ eerie , beautiful , desolate place ” with a strange history . Around the same time , Lu be read John Milton ’ s epic poem Paradise Lost , which mention two different name for ancient Beijing . “ It lead to this idea of two Chinas – a real one and a mythical one , ” he say . “ What might that mythical China be like , and who might be the right person – or in my case , uniquely the wrong person – to tell that story ? ” Ghost Cities be a sprawling , twisty novel that take the reader down mazelike path with no obvious beginning or ending . English and Chinese text stand side by side – Lu be monolingual , so rely on Yuan ’ s help for the latter . The novel also contain secret only the author know ; a a “ private , shy and anxious ” person , he be not interested in write a memoir , but cod his family history into part of Ghost Cities . “ It be a challenge to myself … Is there a way for me to write something that ’ s incredibly personal and to be more visible and exposed , but also have my cake and eat it too , by have it on the page and no one recognise it ? ” he say . “ Artists be so fucking weird . It doesn ’ t bother me that nobody might get it – it ’ s only important to me that it ’ s in the pages. ” Lu ’ s work be intellectually stimulate while also be utterly bonkers – and that ’ s the point . He share some memorable feedback a friend give after read The Whitewash : “ She say the most wonderful thing – ‘ Having read your book , I feel like I ’ ve become smarter , but it ’ s also entirely possible that I ’ ve become dumber , ’ ” he say . “ That ’ s the best compliment anyone could give my writing. ” Ghost Cities by Siang Lu be publish in Australia by UQP on Tuesday', 'Everyone know that the world only reveal it deeper magic and glamour once the child have go to bed .

I find a kit at a craft fair , consist of nothing but a needle , a folded page of instruction and ream of raffia dye in an ombre blue-grey . The picture on the front of the box show a woven pot housing a rubbery succulent . The instruction be simple and I quickly find myself in a methodical rhythm , a coil of raffia slowly grow , curve , take shape under my finger . All of this happen before I speak to Cassie Leatham , a Taungurung master weaver . I suspect it be how many people under st-century capitalism go about learn a craft as old a basket making . But it be in speaking to Leatham that I begin to think there may be a more considered way to go about it . When we speak , Leatham be in Darwin for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards , where some of her art be in the running for an award . Even there , she be weave daily . “ I ’ ve get little piece of grass and raffia and little bone needle on me , and I sit [ and weave ] . I can ’ t stop , ” she tell me . “ I just tread softly and I listen . And I just connect wherever I am. ” Related : Sew sister : the Melbourne gala where ‘ it ’ s not weird to touch each other ’ s clothes ’ Leatham ’ s weaving be not just personal ; it be cultural and sacred .

Made with biodegradable material , basketwork tends to be more perishable than some other craft , but , -year-old item have be find preserve in sand in Egypt , and in , archeologist uncover a complete basket estimate to be more than , year old in a cave in the Judean desert . As Leatham say , “ it ’ s a worldly thing ” . English and Irish basket-makers use willow , hazel and heather . People of the Cherokee Nation use river cane and vine . Techniques include coil , sew , plait and twin and there be structural similarity across disparate tradition . Basketry be inherently tie to landscape management and ( often female ) cultural or spiritual tradition . These day , basket-makers be more likely to use fibre find in a craft store than something pluck from a riverbank with their own hand , but a a crafter in Australia , it ’ s important to engage with the First Nations tradition and be respectful of them , Leatham say . “ You ’ ve really get to sit down with elder or you know , one like myself , and learn the story and connect that way .

When she find out it ’ s my first time at spin cycle , she be delighted . “ I promise you ’ ll want to come back ! ” Today ’ s class be a “ classic ride ” : minute of interval training to track of rap , pop and even Disney . Some class have a music theme , which mean you can do your entire low-impact and high-intensity workout to , say , the Spice Girls , or Rihanna or the Ministry of Sound CD from the s. Our session begin with Cent ’ s In da Club pound through the speaker . We start pedal , and between Cent announce “ It ’ s your birthday ! ” Hannah explain a few basic : the RPM display on our personal screen be how quickly our leg be move , the dial on our bike allow u to increase resistance by spin it to the right , and interval training mean there be moment for recovery .

I , meanwhile , trudge one leg after another with great effort , think only of Hannah ’ s promise of “ recovery ” because I be already experience quite a lot of discomfort . There ’ s no other way to put this : be on the bike hurt my bottom . “ Can you hit RPM ? ” ask Hannah . “ Yeah , you can ! ” I can not . I can barely hit RPM . As the music move to upbeat electronic , then rock , I continue to pedal slowly while stand – anything to avoid sit on the saddle . Others , however , have no problem follow Hannah ’ s instruction to alternate between rid while sit and stand . They even incorporate some basic choreography to occasionally lunge their upper body towards the handlebar . At track , Hannah announce it ’ s time for our leg to have a break – and reveals that it ’ s now time for our arm Past the halfway mark , Hannah ’ s word of encouragement reach a peak : “ Take a look in that mirror … You ’ re do something for your body . There ’ s no ‘ I can ’ t ’ . I can ! I WILL ! ” At this point , my leg be burn and I have no choice but to sit and pedal , which hurt elsewhere .

Like many regional event , local attendance be low , due in part to cost and criticism that the festival need more local representation : only one Arrernte drag queen , Estelle , who live in South Australia , and Alice Springs-born DJ Cliterally perform . There be two local dancer at the night market and during the final party , but they be not advertise a part of the lineup . One local , who do not wish to be name , describe the event a “ incursion rather than invitation ” .

So , to have that brought in , and to be on display , and to see people who be like me … that just give you this sense of safety and sense of belonging. ” Diddams hop more youth event will be incorporate into the festival next year .

Progressive leader concern about the potential cultural pushback of altogether abandon January a the national moment have long be recast it from one of celebratory hubris into a far more sombre memorialisation of how the first fleet so detrimentally collide with a timeless First Nations civilisation . No matter how indignantly the woke-as-a-pejorative crowd screech on their op-ed page and rant into those lonely late-evening airwave about the politically correct try to steal their day , the cultural tide be ebb fast . When the captain of the Australian X , the most respected sporting position in Australia , so eloquently and simply articulate a position a a proud nationalist and change proponent , a Pat Cummins do this week , the self-aware would recognise January be get ever far up creek with no paddle . “ I absolutely love Australia . It ’ s the best country in the world by a mile . We should have an Australia Day , but we can probably find a more appropriate day to celebrate it , ” Cummins say . Cummins go on to mention history ( he ’ s clearly do the work of too few non-Indigenous people ) . But unsaid be what he imply . For January be the day of the apocalypse for Indigenous Australians for whom the dire generational legacy of violent dispossession continue to resoundingly reverberate . Cummins be not some social radical . He ’ s at the apex of one of Australia ’ s most traditional institution . But even conservative Cricket Australia have be progressively drop reference to “ Australia Day ’ ’ ( begin in ) on it January fixture a it will again this year when Australia play the West Indies in the second test . If you turn the cricket off in disgust at how it be reflect – or lead – cultural change ( harrumph – wake nonsense ! ) , you can always follow the money instead . For that be what Woolworths do this year when it discontinue it usual Australia Day range of foreign-produced plastic paraphernalia ( think giant Aussie thong , flag and other assorted shite ) that end up in landfill every January . This be purely , Woolworths CEO Bradford Banducci insist , a commercial decision ; the public call for such rubbish have diminish . From where I sit , when uber capitalism start to so acutely ape cultural direction , it ’ s definitely time to take notice . Which be perhaps why the woke-as-pejorative lot cheerleader , the federal opposition leader , seem to tie himself in such ideologically tricky knot of outrage . Why else would an avowed free-marketeer and purported defender of free speech call for a boycott of Woolworths , insist it be act against the national interest ( stop roll round on the floor ) ? Unless , of course , what ’ s say about him and belief really be true . Meanwhile , do you hear about the wildly successful and hardy perennial campaign to make barbecuing and share lamb on January a thing of national togetherness ? Traditionally the expensive high-production , humorous ad have mention Australia Day to underscore the supposed patriotism of lamb consumption . Not this year . As always , the ad be imbue with patriotism , and the mending of societal fence and division ( incongruously , give Australia have just say a resounding “ no ” to Indigenous constitutional recognition ) . But again , no mention of Australia Day . Is that the delicious aroma of barbecue lamb … or money ? Australia Day be on the nose . Here it ’ s worth remember that pastoral expansion through violent dispossession of Indigenous custodian for the production of livestock be the very sharp end of British colonial ambition in Australia . Colonial pastoral pioneering be a revered part of this continent ’ s narrative of benign settlement , it true discomfiting history too often overlooked . Stock – their theft by Black people and Indigenous resistance to pastoral expansion on traditional land – trigger the killing of countless Indigenous people ( and many pastoralists ) . And while we be on overlooked history this Invasion/Australia Day , here ’ s a couple more thing to ponder . First , you ’ ll probably hear an awful lot about Arthur Phillip today , not least about his supposed enlightenment regard the indigene , and the pride and personal importance to him of his colonial project in what grow from New South Wales to become Australia . The truth be that Phillip ( a illustrate by historian Kate Fullagar in her recent book on the first governor and Bennelong ) be a very sharp instrument of the colonial project , not so enlightened , and later give not too much of a fig about his time in the great southern land . Second , be the bicentenary of the establishment of the NSW Legislative Council , appoint to advise the governor ( then Thomas Brisbane ) on British colonial legislative matter . It grow into the later elect bicameral NSW parliament , the first on the continent . As NSW upper house MP Jeremy Buckingham point out , next August will mark year since “ the colonial government ’ s declaration of martial law west of the Blue Mountains on the Wiradjuri nation ” in the “ Bathurst war ’ ’ , which massacre by poison , beat and shoot hundred of Wiradjuri . “ Eleven day after the Declaration of Martial law , the first meeting of the Legislative Council be hold . . . The very first decision of the NSW Legislative Council be to appoint Lieutenant Governor Colonel William Stewart , who be integral to the formation and ultimately lead the New South Wales Mounted Police who enforce British rule on the Wiradjuri Nation and Aboriginal nation across the colony , ” Buckingham say . Racism be undeniably at the heart of the colonial project , so many will celebrate with blithe indifference to Indigenous sensibility on Friday . Just a it be the bedrock of the Australian federation in , whose first commonwealth act be the white Australia legislation .

But boot and shoe-shaped drinking vessel date back to the second millennium BCE have be find in Asia Minor , while later example have be find in Azerbaijan and Armenia .

As co-artistic director of intercultural dance theatre company Marrugeku , Pigram look to her grandfather for idea on how Indigenous Australia can connect at a human level .

Over , year , generation have pass story down through dance , but now , a the custodian of culture seek to increasingly share their tradition , an existential question arises : how to keep First Nations performance thriving and relevant to contemporary audience ? One month before the referendum , Marrugeku conclude an international tour of it show Jurrungu Ngan-ga , translate from Yawuru a “ straight talk ” . The show , which meld First Nations traditional dance , voguing , hip-hop and even shade of classical , be not only about Australia ’ s high Indigenous incarceration rate but how much those Aboriginal nation , asylum seeker and transgender Australians represent on stage have in common with the audience .

It be be bill a “ a revolutionary moment for Australian dance ” which aim to “ think , dream and plant the seed of the future ” . The conference have no formal agenda , but cross-cultural collaboration will likely be a priority , a will discussion about federal and state art funding , which company say fall short . Pigram say Marrugeku have always understand it profound responsibility to explore Australians ’ share history , but post-referendum the need to heal have sharply focus the Yolŋu concept of Makarrata : to come together after a struggle . “ You can fee into stereotype , ” she say , “ or you can start to open people ’ s heart and minds. ” Part of that process involve confrontation with historical truth : Marrugeku ’ s most recent production , for instance , Mutiara , be about Broome ’ s pearl industry and the forced labour practice of blackbirding ; the show be praise a a “ surprisingly delicate , otherworldly memory piece ” .

The top sleeve feature an exaggerated cuff which cover the model ’ s hand – though this be offset by a ruffle which run along the collarbone . Davies like to use fabric that be rich in texture include silk organza , chiffon , leather , cotton , linen and remnant upholstery fabric .

One of the most time-consuming piece in the collection be a pale blue polyester dress that have be ruched and drape on a mannequin , then fix in shape with a heat gun to make the synthetic material melt and set . Worn on the runway with a match sheer veil , the effect of the heat-set draping give the dress a wet look , while a flowing asymmetrical skirt create an feminine line through the waist .

In the near future , you will be able to sign different deal for key appliance so that you can be pay for turn them off or even supply power back to the grid at peak time . At least that ’ s the vision under draft rule aim at change how power company and consumer interact . The new draft electricity and retail rule , release on Thursday by the Australian Energy Market Commission for public feedback , be aim at open the way for household and business to sign up service for different power us . Competition would be expect to drive down power price and foster innovation although more consumer protection would need to be in place before multiple supplier could be tap . The proposed rule change would unleash the potential for household with solar panel , battery , EVs and other load that can be use flexibly such a hot-water system to capture the benefit these asset offer the grid , say commission chair Anna Collyer .

EVs , in particular , be expect to grow rapidly in popularity , with many of them likely to offer the capability of feed power back into the grid if need . An AEMC report , release on Thursday , state that there will be about m EVs in Australia by . Their storage capacity would approach six time the planned MW capacity of the giant Snowy Hydro . pump hydro project now be build , Collyer say . The need to spread the power sector risk be underscore by storm damage to a transmission line and local pole and wire in Victoria earlier this month that cut power to half a million home . A spike in temperature on Thursday may also strain the power grid in New South Wales and Queensland . Collyer say Australia ’ s world-leading take-up of rooftop solar panel – with about .m home generate their own power – mean other nation be look to Australia on how the grid can be shift off fossil fuel . Along with open the way for household to have multiple contract , the commission ’ s propose rule would also support large commercial energy user to follow suit . Even council , which increasingly run street light with their own type of electricity meter , could also benefit from the change . The commission would also be work to ensure compliance and enforcement standard be in place to ensure user ’ safety , Collyer say . Smart meter would likely be need for household take part . Such device be already standard in Victoria and % in Tasmania with the rollout in other state now about % . The propose reform , though , should enable cheaper meter to be use , with some of them effectively embed already in EVs and some other device . Submissions on the propose rule change close on April , with a final determination set for July and implementation in early February . The commission be likely to release a separate draft determination for smart meter next month , with rule to be finalise by mid-year and a start date set for July . The aim be to have % of Australia ’ s home hook up to smart meter by . Meanwhile the Clean Energy Regulator on Wednesday release greenhouse gas emission data for the - year .

Justice Jonathan Beach decide to hear the two case and an associated class action at the same time to avoid duplication of witness evidence . David and Goliath ? In the Australian case , which originally kick off in , Epic Games have allege that Apple ’ s control over in-app purchase and it action in ban the Fortnite app be a misuse of market power , which have substantially lessen competition in app development . The company have also allege Google harm app developer and consumer in Australia by prevent choice over app distribution and in-app payment on Android device . Just like their phone operate system , the legal case between Apple and Google have many similarity – but also key point of difference . Apple ’ s iOS and App Store be completely close and control by Apple . That mean if an app be on your phone , and there be a payment through that app , it have to go through Apple . Similar rule operate on Google ’ s Android operate system for the Play Store , but Google also allow “ sideloading ” of apps – meaning apps instal directly on the phone without use the app store . It also allow for phone manufacturer such a Samsung to have their own app store . Fortnite be still available on Android , but only through sideloading or through the Samsung store . Each company charge fee for transaction in their app store . Google Play charge a % fee for the first US $ m earn by developer each year , increase to % above that . Apple developer pay a % fee if the revenue generate the previous year be lower than $ m , but pay % if they earn more than that .

In the Apple case , the judge take a narrower view , consider mobile game transaction specifically rather than the app store a a whole . The judge find that Apple be not a monopoly , instead it be compete against Google and others . The judge also back Apple ’ s concern about the security implication of open up the App Store , and support the company seek a fee for the use of it intellectual property through in-app payment . Apple be expect to run a very similar case in Australia . The company believe there be little difference between the case , and the principle underlie Australian competition law be similar to those in US antitrust law . Apple see Epic not as David to it Goliath , but a a multibillion dollar company seek to further profit at the expense of the security of iPhone user . Google argue it do offer customer a choice in app store , as well a alternative option for developer to sell content outside Google Play . It also point to it permission allow the sideloading of apps while also try to preserve security for user – something it argue Epic be attempt to water down . “ It ’ s clear that Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform and it ’ s a model that ’ s good for Australian developer and consumer , ” Google ’ s VP of government affair and public policy , Wilson White , say in a post this week .

So , this be evidently somebody human . “ I have no idea right then whether the cranium mean that the full body be there but it be sufficient to excite the possibility that here we have evidence of another ancient human deeply in the dune. ” Throughout the th and well into the th centuries physical anthropologist and anatomist have , through the widespread theft and collection of human skull , try to prove Australian Aboriginal people represent a step in the evolutionary chain between ape and modern people . While this theory be already be debunk , some researcher be still look for sign of Neanderthal and Homo erectus in the remains of Aboriginal people steal from traditional burial ground – though none nearly so old a Mungo Man and Lady , inhabitant of the last ice age . “ I realise that it be the beginning of a new day [ of knowledge ] , ” Bowler say . Within hour his associate from the Australian National University – chiefly Bowler ’ s mentor John Mulvaney – know a the father of Australian archaeology – have arrive to excavate the bone . “ So we be then just brush away the sand cover and very quickly we saw unfold before our eye this remarkable testimony to human antiquity deep in the core of the ancient dune. ” Bowler concedes today that the event be “ exciting ” and inspire “ a sense of elation ” among the academic , of whom he be the last alive . But with hindsight , he suggest such elation and academic pride can be “ dangerous ” when deal with the removal of ancestral remain no matter what scientific knowledge they might advance or myths debunk . The removal – or a some Indigenous people say , steal – of the bone be not broadly controversial at the time , come a it do after a long Australian tradition of cultural theft of ancestral remains , not least by Murray Black , who supply hundred of skeleton and skull to the Australian Institute of Anatomy . As a much younger man in Gippsland , Bowler know and be appal by Black . Asked if it felt “ heretical or disrespectful ” to remove the Mungo remain , Bowler say , “ not at the time ” . “ Sadly at that stage there be no known presence of Indigenous people [ a local custodian ] – no one with whom we could consult , let alone share the significance of that occasion , or [ from whom to ] request removal [ of the remains ] , ” he say . “ Science have be operate on some disgraceful treatment of Indigenous remains . That sense of disrespect have not yet dawn … There at the time be not … a conscious reflection of shame . But it be now see a a gross misrepresentation of what we should have be do … We would treat those remains very differently today. ’ ’ Contact with traditional owner – lead in part by now decease Mutthi Mutthi elder Alice Kelly – do not happen for several year , by which time Mungo Man and Lady be secure at the ANU .

With the traditional owner , Bowler and Mulvaney agitate for the remains to be take home and respectfully inter . Mungo Man be bring back to country in after Mungo Lady be return .

The reburial be put forward by the Aboriginal advisory group comprise member of the three traditional owner group that advise the New South Wales bureaucracy on traditional land management at Willandra Lakes region . Some individual member of the advisory group oppose the reburial . The reburial have be divisive in local Aboriginal community . Some want a more monumental interment , others a memorial . Jason Kelly , the grandson of Alice Kelly , remain anger by the secret reburial , which he try to stop . “ It go against my grandmother ’ s wish , who didn ’ t want them secretly put into the ground – but [ into ] a keep place , respectfully and securely. ” Kelly and his father , Danny Kelly ( the only live child of Alice ) , and his uncle , Ngiyampaa elder Roy Kennedy , now in his s , be among those traditional owner who join Bowler and his family on the shore of Lake Mungo this week . Bowler and several elder have hop to visit the reburial site . But the advisory group reject the proposal . “ It be critical for them to be able to be there with Jim , ” Kelly say . “ It be wonderful to be there but it be disappoint that the elder could not go out to the actual [ secret ] reburial site . And it be disappoint for my father and Uncle Roy that the whole country didn ’ t realise that this be the th anniversary and what Mungo Man mean to the country and the world. ” While Bowler say he felt the need to be close to where he discover Mungo Man , the day be also ting with disappointment that he could not go to the place of reburial and that these oldest discover Indigenous Australians have be bury without ceremony . “ They do not deserve to be secretly bury without honour , ” Bowler say . “ In contrast to the ritual ceremony that be enact there , year ago , the secret reburial remain a sad moment . Though it ’ s not one that we want to concentrate on . Time have pass . Some mistake have be make – we ’ ve all make mistake . We now have to move on to the next step. ” That step , he say , should be a year-long dialogue of conciliation “ to find that heal glue ” in the wake of the defeat of the constitutional recognition referendum last October . “ There be a need for heal – the need for dialogue between the different culture have not be resolve . With the failure of the referendum , there be an urgent need to search for the healing glue . What be it that can now unite the nation ? I ’ m suggest it be the example of the Mungo people and their deep connection to the land and the spiritual dimension that that embrace , a the human most closely connect to the cosmos. ” Kelly agree . “ His proposal for a dialogue around Mungo be spot-on . My grandmother always promote it a a place of heal . And a a place of education for all Australians … We have never come close to realise the potential of Mungo a a place of global cultural and spiritual and human importance. ” Bowler , at , may yet return to Lake Mungo .

She play detective Andie Whitford , a city cop who have be relocate to the town of Brokenridge in the titular Victorian region , where the magisterial beauty of mountain , valley , river and creek have be taint somewhat by the proliferation of dead body and disappearance . Co-created by Marcia Gardner and John Ridley , and co-directed by Kevin Carlin and Beck Cole , the show arrive hot on the heel of the feature film Force of Nature : The Dry , which be also ( mostly ) base in wet-looking Victorian wilderness , also involve a miss person ’ s case , and also deploy a clever detective from the big smoke .

There be some scene and some character , however , that I want more time with . In the second episode , for instance , when Whitford meet an Aboriginal woman who inspire her to connect to country ; she ’ s play by the always-great Trisha Morton-Thomas , who ’ s criminally underused in Australian film and television and only very briefly appear here .

After his apparent “ vision ” lead to the discovery of a child ’ s corpse , he become a pariah and be now the prime suspect in the current investigation . Whitford boldly bring Damien into the case a a consultant , in an effort to trap him ; meanwhile , Dyson see Damien a his white whale and devote his retirement to pursue him , convince of his guilt . A wall in the ex-cop ’ s home be plaster with photograph , note and diagram ; what would a mystery crime series be without one ? If you ’ re think this all sound familiar , High Country be , indeed , a grab bag of genre element . It ’ s clear the storyteller have some trick up their sleeve , inevitably deliver twist , turn and misdirection en route to an eventual grand reveal ( this review cover the first four episode ) . It ’ s never badly stag , even if aspect of the write feel very engineered – very “ pay attention , because this might be important ” . Even casual appreciator of the genre can start to see pattern and second-guess otherwise ordinary occurrence . In these story it ’ s common for screenwriter to double down on the “ this time it ’ s personal ” element , which often feel contrive . As soon a Kirra be introduce , I think “ uh-oh she ’ s go to find herself in trouble later , when Whitford ’ s professional and personal life collide ” . It ’ s hard for any actor to meaningfully deliver line like “ something just doesn ’ t sit right ” and “ you get ta look at every angle ” but Purcell make a good fist of it ; from the start you feel a though you ’ re in good hand . She have an engaging presence and be probably the show ’ s best asset . Nixon be strong too , in a difficult role that require the viewer to entertain the possibility of both Damien ’ s innocence and his guilt . His character represent an interesting predicament : if he ’ s a villain , he ’ s bizarrely brazen ; if he ’ s innocent , the story must do something to address those “ vision ” . When High Country enters more enigmatic territory , draw on symbolism and mythology , you can sense it start to buckle under the strain . This production isn ’ t on the same level a the Mystery Road series , or a Vicki Madden production à la The Gloaming and The Kettering Incident , which tap into higher and bolder space – but High Country be still thoroughly decent and I ’ m curious to see how it end .

One be a half hearted interrogation of capital and power and their influence on art , tell via millennial character whose hubris and privilege speak of who wield control in creative industry . The other be a modern romance between two people with a mutual yet spar love of art in a novel that mostly treat art and artist like a beguiling yet uninterrogated backdrop – like a painting in a restaurant . Lee ’ s other work – the acclaimed Eggshell Skull and two follow-up , Beauty and Who Gets to Be Smart – be each memoir-infused nonfiction , respectively tackle Australia ’ s inadequate justice system for sexual assault and rape survivor , beauty standard and institution , and correlation between privilege and knowledge . In her foray into fiction , Lee bring her familiarity with sociocultural issue – and part of herself again , a she ’ s mention – to The Work , use the lens of gender inequity , power and class to scrutinise the cultural sector ’ s gatekeeper and profiteer . Related : ‘ Candid ’ , ‘ remarkable ’ , ‘ beguile ’ : the best Australian book out in April Whether the novel accomplishes this be another question . The Work , split between New York and Sydney , alternate between two character : Lally , a career-focused thirtysomething American who be the owner of a contemporary gallery in Manhattan , and Patrick , an Australian bloke in his late s from regional Queensland now work a a junior appraiser at a prestigious antiquity company in Sydney . Both have work hard for their success ; both unconsciously lie to themselves about the certain privilege they enjoy ( an “ unexpected inheritance ” , male privilege ) . The novel ’ s tension stem from Lally and Patrick ’ s relationship ( they have a meet-cute through work , exchange flirty barb , have a lot of sex ) in tandem with their unfolding career mistake . Lally , in her bid to fee “ what the market hunger for ” , commission an installation by the controversial artist Chuck Farr , which she persist with despite historical allegation of coercion against him from several male model . Patrick , meanwhile , find himself in a precarious position after have sex with his first major client , a divorcee look to pawn off her former husband ’ s asset . Sign up for our rundown of must-reads , pop culture and tip for the weekend , every Saturday morning Art isn ’ t the focus of The Work ; Lee herself say it ’ s more about “ real estate ” . That ’ s true , and the novel be most compelling when illustrate the market ’ s ever-shifting perception of cultural value , our gendered ideal of creativity , and the machinery that distribute and profit from it . It ’ s self-aware of performative currency in “ young and diverse ” artist – Lally bat no eyelid push the “ devastated-migrant-son angle ” for a photography series – with the novel ’ s character attune to the inequity of their industry while remain complicit in uphold them . However , the novel ’ s limp handling of art detracts from the plot . There be moment when it convincingly engage with it ethic and politics , such a when Lally contend with the moral ambiguity of Farr ’ s provocative video work . But lazy obscurity creep in : Farr ’ s work hit “ that sweet spot in Lally ’ s aesthetic-intellectual interior ” , and circular , platitudinous conversation abound . Characters also often refer simply to “ art ” , untethered from any medium or idea : ‘ Do most of your friend do other kind of work ? ’ she ask . ‘ You mean not-art ? ’ ‘ Yes . There ’ s art , and then there ’ s everything else. ’ Are these satirical jab at industry cliche or authorial flatness ? Who know . But a passion for artistic expression be seemingly the underpinning of Lally and Pat ’ s bud romance , we ’ re leave a bit bored . Also , for such an unabashedly horny book – which Lee say be aim at challenge the male-dominated canon of badly write sex – so much of it eroticism , though frank and explicit , veers into the comically stilted . We jump from jar description ( breast like “ panna cottas ” ) to prose deaden by anatomical specificity : “ She grab his left hand , place it on her breast , climb onto him , and put his right hand on her arse. ” Lines like “ Lally felt desperate to … get their physical in sync with their intellectual ” evoke all the sensuality of back up your iCloud . In The Work , neither Lally nor Patrick face any real consequence for their sin . They don ’ t need to , of course , but it function in the novel feel less a knowing wink towards the reality of the art sector than something simply elide for the sake of the love story . Indeed , the novel ’ s bow-tied end – admittedly culminate in an authentic depiction of a modern relationship – defang any claim it may have have a a barbed skewering of money and power .

I feel like I ’ m undercover . Soon , though , I will be grateful to be literally under cover . It begin to bucket down from the dark grey sky – real end-of-days vibe and oddly fit for a sport that trace it history back to hunting and warfare , although perhaps that be too long a bow to draw . Related : My first time in a float tank : ‘ The only part of me I be sure still exist be my head ’ The archery centre be a long pavilion with a corrugated roof , which mean we can stand under cover to shoot at target that be out on the lawn metres away . ( For professional , the target be metres away . ) My instructor today be Virasha , who appreciate archery a a sport that can be quite calm . After a brief safety run-through cover arrow ( sharp on both end ) , bow ( don ’ t “ dry fire ” : only pull a bow back if you intend to shoot , otherwise it might crack and explode ) and shoot ( only aim at the target , not at the sky or people ) , we begin . I stand in line with the target and Virasha show me how to line up the end of the arrow ( the notch ) so that it click on to the string of the bow . I hold the bow with my left arm and place the three middle finger of my right hand on the string . When I pull my right arm all the way back there ’ s a fair bit of resistance . There ’ s so much tension it ’ s like a romantic comedy ! I aim . I release . And the arrow go fly to the left of the target . Cupid I be not . “ It ’ s OK , ” say Virasha . “ Sometimes it take people a whole hour. ” I have six arrow leave . The second also fly past the target . In the rain , I can ’ t see where it ’ s land . Third time lucky : the arrow hit the blue ring and the sound of it strike the board be exhilarate .

Stray arrows hit the ground with such force they end up quite deep in the soil . Arrows on the target be slippery from the rain and require both hand to yank out . Soon Virasha and I be drench . Next Virasha teach me how to anchor my right hand to my face when I pull back the string and to look out of my right eye ( a a right-handed person ) instead of both eye . I learn to inhale when pull back the string and to exhale on release . When Virasha say : “ If you want to hit the target , always aim lower , ” I can ’ t help but laugh –and want to apply this wisdom to life and goal-setting . The experience bring to mind the difference between beginner ’ s luck and how one ’ s perception of success might change with time . “ A lot of people think that if they get one in the yellow , one in the blue , one in the black , they ’ re shoot amazingly , ” say Virasha . “ But you ’ re not show consistency of technique . You want all your arrow to land together . Even if they all land in a clump in the black , it show you ’ re shoot with technique , it ’ s just your aim be off. ” During my last round of seven shot , six hit the target and three manage to land in the same area of a blue ring . This have completely exceed my expectation a a short-sighted person who usually only take aim at thing ( metaphorically ) on stage for laugh . Briefly I entertain thought that my newfound skill might help me survive an end-of-days situation . Might I be able to make it a a hunter ? Perhaps . If the target be metre away , remain stationary and be the size of a monster truck tyre ...

I ’ ve be a lesbian for several decade , and at no point in my memory have I ever see such a saturation ( the collective noun ) of queer woman in pop culture . A Homo-moment , if you will . It feel like it all kick off with the Women ’ s World Cup last year , which draw the gaze of thousand of queer woman to Australia . Now we be saturate the rest of culture . There ’ s always be a sprinkling here and there of course , but it ’ s never really be fashionable to be a lesbian before now . I don ’ t mean clothes-wise ; I still exclusively wear jorts .

Then there ’ s -year-old Chappell Roan and her breakthrough song Good Luck , Babe ! , which have become unexpectedly important to me . Although I ’ ve be an incredibly well-adjusted and out lesbian woman for age now , there be a part of me that find the sudden inclusion of queerness into widespread culture in recent year slightly complicate . On the one hand ( the MUCH bigger hand , a freakishly large hand ) , this have be wonderful and heartwarming to witness .

It ’ s a certified banger about the concept of compulsory heterosexuality . It ’ s some sort of musical miracle , like an indie rock hit about polyamory .

Even though I be very far from , very openly gay , very happy with my girlfriend , and very over it , this song have be cathartic . To be able to sing along with Roan about the exact emotion experience in this niche situation have be heal . Of course I ’ ve relate to song before , but I ’ ve always have to do some adjustment in my head . They don ’ t feel quite right , like wrong-sized jorts . Or it ’ s me in my bedroom listen to a sad lesbian song . Roan ’ s song fit like a gay glove . It ’ s about heartbreak and sadness , but it ’ s joyous , spirit , and a bit smug .

In the comment , a who ’ s who of Australian hip-hop – B Wise , Maya Jupiter , Nooky and Dobby – extol the label alongside hundred of reverent comment from fan and fellow musos . Speaking with Guardian Australia over the phone in May , Levinson say the decision be a long time in the making . He now live in Newcastle , a move that have “ coincide with the last few year of the music industry , which have throw so many curveballs ” . He ’ s be “ wake up at three or four every morning ” , he say , stress about the upcoming run of Elefant Traks finale show happen across Australia . The way Levinson tell it , Elefant Traks become another casualty of an increasingly ruthless music landscape . “ You can look at stream number and ticket sale and see thing aren ’ t work like they once be . And [ it ’ s ] the unforgiving environment that new and emerging artist be walk out into. ” Levinson say he and his tight-knit team of four “ could see where thing be go ” two year ago , when they be force out of their longtime headquarters on Marrickville ’ s Faversham Street . Levinson describe their final move to a new office a few block away a “ put all our chip down ” on a business struggle to stay afloat . “ Our industry have always be gambler and thief and crook , and wholesome , good-hearted people try to make a difference , ” he say . “ We be not affiliate with any major and have never be a subsidiary of anyone .

The “ completely DIY ” operation , run out of makeshift space in Surry Hills , Redfern and Enmore , include work bee to burn CDs and distribute them to record store . “ We saw this music industry and we didn ’ t fit in , ” Sabir say . “ So we just … do it our way. ” Sabir remember a moment early in the Herd ’ s run “ when someone say to u , ‘ Oh , you guy look like the United Colors of Benetton. ’ ” While the band have a “ white front ” in Ozi Batla and Urthboy , Sabir add , “ when we ’ d tour , people would see our diverse makeup . We ’ d be in country town and me and Kaho [ Cheung , AKA Unkle Ho ] would get some racist remark , and then later on would see those kid in the crowd at the gig. ” Their diversity embolden Elefant Traks to buck the aggressively white embrace of Australian hip-hop against the backdrop of the Cronulla riot . “ There be so much racism and nationalism in Australia , ” Levinson say . “ When the local hip-hop scene start really build big audience , a lot of it appeal be to kid wave flag and make people kiss them at the Big Day Out . Bigger hip-hop label be use ‘ Aussie , Aussie , Aussie , oi , oi , oi ’ in their shit – it be cringe . We felt like our role be to be fuck counter to that. ” The industry at large , Levinson recall , “ take great glee in look at the hip-hop community and say , ‘ Wow , there ’ s problem there. ’ It give them all an excuse to not have any self-reflection about how undeniably white and racist the rest of the Australian music industry was. ” As it happen , the label ’ s biggest breakout success be not a hip-hop act , but electronic duo Hermitude . After year of steady release on Elefant Traks , Flume ’ s sleek remix of HyperParadise bring the duo to the attention of Nettwerk Music Group ’ s Rachel Cragg , who push Hermitude ’ s single The Buzz to a worldwide dance fanbase . “ Elefant Traks be the first time that I ’ d work with an artist-run label , ” Cragg say over Zoom from her home in Canada . “ As an artist himself , Tim be able to give a kind of creative feedback that most [ industry ] people can ’ t. ” Sabir say the duo , who he affectionately refer to a Hermi , tell a “ beautiful story ” of the synergy between artist and independent label . “ What major label be go to support an act across that many record , before a big return ? ” he muse . Cragg agree . “ It ’ s the classic -year overnight success , ” she say . “ It take a certain type of label and community to stick with artist over the long term. ” At a time when act like Onefour , and Genesis Owusu be redefine Australian hip-hop on the world stage , Levinson feel certain “ there ’ s more talent in than there ’ s ever be , by a long way ” . That say , he ’ s struggle with “ the bigger , more profound question ” of how to connect young people with the life-altering power of music when the traditional mechanism keep fail . As a scrappy young artist , Levinson tell journalist he didn ’ t want to be “ another old white guy run the shop ” in year . As he consider the legacy and ultimate end of Elefant Traks , that conviction hasn ’ t waver . “ Culture have to remain open to the most exciting voice and idea , ” he say . “ Of course , I would love for our reputation to create all sort of foundation for new artist to thrive on .

And yet this be what must be do . My father , when he die two year ago , leave behind an inaccessible office , the doorway block by magazine and document , obstruct the path to a desk hide under pile of box , book , photo album and stationery . Towards the room ’ s wall , thing be increasingly orderless . Stacks fold into one another , form shapeless mass of paper and plastic , the floor completely conceal .

If living area be uncluttered , it be only because of the intervention of third parties. ” My father never saw a therapist , so be never diagnose , but this describe his situation . The condition , often itself a response to grief and trauma , upon death , complicate the grief of those who inherit the hoard . Around Christmas last year , my mother bravely decide that she be able to face the room , set herself the goal of discard at least one full bag a day . I fly to Brisbane to help out . We be meticulous , consider each object to ensure that we weren ’ t accidentally dispose of a birth certificate or a bar of gold ( which , my geologist father remark before he die , be bury somewhere under the detritus ) . Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads , pop culture and tip for the weekend , every Saturday morning The cleaning take on a ritualistic aspect , whereby we separate the small number of thing we intend to keep , from the recycling , from the rubbish , from the document that have to be shred . As we work , material keep for it contemporary relevance but now decades old take on a kind of archaeological charm : an Ansett timetable ; a how-to-vote card explain “ How to re-elect the Hawke government ” ; a Sunday Telegraph declare “ Thatcherism crumble ” ; a yellowing brochure advertise the opening of Stockland Nathan Plaza , “ Townsville ’ s Largest Most Exciting Shopping Centre ” .

Discarding may entail an admission of the inevitability of death but it can also account for the precious fragility of life My father possess a voracious intellect , be astoundingly quick-witted and movingly kind . He train and work a a geologist , a taxi driver and a translator , read Don Quixote in Spanish and Proust in French . Every facet of life fascinate him and every manifestation of his general fascination be a virtue , with one notable exception : a desire to gather a much of the world a possible into his custody . I be sympathetic to the view that every object be a marvel . Any piece of furniture , book , magazine , fork , poster , roll of paper towel , if glimpse from the right angle , gesture towards the miracle of it invention and the anticipation of a future in which it will be use , appreciated . But my father would have need to out-age Methuselah in order to simply read the book he own , and would have undoubtedly use such a lifespan to collect too many more . Related : The moment I know : grief almost push me under but he hold me to his chest and at last I exhale Discarding may entail an admission of the inevitability of death but it can also account for the precious fragility of life .

Breathing become uncomfortable . I have to steel myself to cough . The damage might have come from hold up the hefty telephoto lens while photograph bird on a nearby wetland or from sit at a desk with my left arm – the afflicted one – almost immobile for hour . Or it might have come from something sneakier that develop unnoticed until it cross a threshold . I be certain the pain would resolve itself in a few day – then a few more day , and a few more after that . My mistake . My shoulder stop work . When I struggle to lift my arm , it felt a though it be tear apart . I have a frozen shoulder . Frozen shoulder affect – % of the population , and be report slightly more frequently in woman than in men . It tend to develop between the age of and , with a peak incidence among people in their mid-s . Despite it prevalence , it be one of those condition that tend to slip under the radar unless – or until – you be affect by it . “ It ’ s a bugger of a condition , ” Hobart radiologist Philippa Taplin tell me . Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads , pop culture and tip for the weekend , every Saturday morning To understand frozen shoulder , it help to know the structure of the joint . The rounded head of the upper arm bone ( humerus ) fit into a small , shallow bowl on the shoulder blade ( scapula ) , allow a greater range of movement than any other joint . The junction of the two bone be cushion by cartilage and enclose in fluid-filled capsule of tissue . Normally , the capsule be baggy – Taplin describe it a “ like a deflated balloon ” – to allow free movement , but when inflame it tighten , effectively clamp the joint . The condition be know medically a adhesive capsulitis . Adhesions be scar that stick to other tissue ; capsulitis be inflammation of the capsule . “ When the capsule be inflame , the shoulder be frozen and can ’ t move in any direction . It hurt because of that inflammation and because the scar stick together . Once the scar start , it just get worse. ” The shoulder be the most flexible joint in the body . It allow you to windmill your arm to hit a power chord ( not me ) , raise weight above your head in a power lift ( also not me ) , and reach back to adjust cushion for a power nap ( me ) . It be also the most complex joint . The ball-and-socket arrangement of an upper arm and shoulder blade be only one element . Shoulder movement involve the collarbone and rib cage and a multitude of muscle , tendon and ligament . When the capsule become inflame , the effect extend outward . They extend inward too . Frozen shoulder also have an impact on mental well-being . Exactly what trigger a frozen shoulder remain relatively poorly understood . Diabetes can be a factor in it development , with as many a % of people with diabetes experience the condition . Sometimes it be precipitate by an injury . When Louise Zedda-Sampson break her arm , part of her rehabilitation program involve try to minimise the risk of frozen shoulder . “ Because you don ’ t want that , ” medical professional inform her . But often frozen shoulder be idiopathic – it happen with no identifiable precursor . Younger woman I speak to say they hadn ’ t heard of it . But when I talk to woman closer to my age – the peak age for frozen shoulder – there be plenty of story to share . Patti Miller develop frozen shoulder on her dream trip to Paris . Soon after arrive , her shoulder start to ache . “ It felt a if someone have be hit the top of my arm with a baseball bat. ” For Cate McKeown , it begin with a sore shoulder that come on gradually . “ Then suddenly it get really bad . I could no longer put my arm up when hang out the washing , ” she tell me . I couldn ’ t get over how many time you use a shoulder . Tamara Playne Shoulder pain be the first phase . The second phase , reduce mobility , often extend for a year or more . The mild-sounding term ‘ frozen shoulder ’ downplay it profound effect on everyday activity . Washing , dress , cooking , driving , even sign a form become painful and difficult . Something as straightforward a walk the dog turn into an exercise in planning . “ You can step on a lead , but you still need two hand to open a dog poo bag , ” say Tamara Playne . “ I couldn ’ t get over how many time you use a shoulder. ” Unable to lift the camera , I abandon photography . In do so , my world contract . I have lose the joy and energy that come from record fleet moment in nature . Playne give up bass guitar while the condition persist . McKeown put netball on hold . Frozen shoulder lead to lower activity . It affect every aspect of life . A qualitative study of frozen shoulder patient by a team of researcher at Flinders Medical Centre , find that the pain , lack of sleep , and loss of independence have profound psychological impact . This be often compound by the feeling that what they be go through be not understand by their friend and family , and sometimes not even by their medical practitioner , who might be unfamiliar with the condition and not know how to deal with it . The FMC study and others have suggest that frozen shoulder can sometimes lead to an altered sense of self . As well a the impact on daily living , it also prevent sufferer from spending time with those close to them , and take part in favourite hobby and sport . The third and final phase be a ‘ thawing ’ a the stiffness and contracture slowly dissipate and the shoulder recovers mobility . This proceeds at a glacial pace and can take between and month to resolve . A shoulder might never regain the full range of movement – both Playne and I be still limit in the extent to which we can raise our arm – but it be a relief to be able to do all those activity again unaided . ( Including bag dog poo . ) Maria Kallas , a physiotherapist with a special interest in shoulder , say prompt treatment be the key to deal with it . “ People can ’ t move , can ’ t sleep , can ’ t cope with work or family . They ’ re in pain and be look for an answer. ” In it early stage , frozen shoulder can sometimes be mistake for rotator cuff injury , so it be important to find a practitioner with a knowledge of shoulder problem . “ Get quick advice within the first couple of week . There be good , strong treatment pathway and good way of management. ” It turn out I do the wrong thing by stretch when the pain first start . Pain management couple with treatment to reduce inflammation be more effective . “ Keep thing cruisy in the developing phase , ” Kallas say . “ Movement be for later. ” Physiotherapy and tailor exercise be beneficial in the second phase . I still don ’ t know what cause my frozen shoulder . Some suggest that stress can trigger the inflammation link to frozen shoulder , or that the condition sometimes correlate with people suffer from depression or anxiety . Patti Miller suspect that drag a heavy suitcase across cobble might have play a part in her situation . Tamara Playne wonder if a birthday surprise for her husband , where she steer him through Brisbane to the Gabba while he be blindfold , could have precipitate hers . When Cate McKeown develop the condition , she be tell that it would eventually come good . But , she be caution , it could appear in the other shoulder ( recurrence in the opposite shoulder can affect – % of patient , usually within five year ) . It do . But , the second time around sufferer know what ’ s ahead and that help them to cope . With experience come an understanding of the condition , the limitation it impose and , crucially , that it will end . “ I be more patient with it the second time , ” say McKeown . “ I know what be happen and what to expect . ”', 'My love of the internet start young , and it be now stronger and more of an addiction than ever .

What be le commonly know be that these little bug be NOT fruit fly : they ’ re vinegar fly ( Drosophila melanogaster ) , otherwise know a ferment fly . Some people may not even recognise “ true ” fruit fly – the one that decimate orchard and threaten Australia ’ s $ .bn horticulture industry – because they ’ re bigger than the vinegar fly they ’ re commonly mistake for . Sign up for our rundown of must-reads , pop culture and tip for the weekend , every Saturday morning “ Vinegar fly be tiny fly about the size of a pinhead and have red eye , ” say Dr Brendan Missenden , senior entomologist at Queensland ’ s Department of Agriculture and Fisheries . “ Whereas true fruit fly be about the size of a housefly , so they ’ re quite solid and chunky . Some people think they ’ re wasp because they ’ re brightly colour with patch of yellow and patterned wings. ” Know your fly It ’ s important to know the difference , because real fruit fly can appear in back yard and even in fruit bowl and need to be report immediately . Not only can outbreaks cripple the fruit industry and farmer ’ livelihood , if not detect you might bite into a fresh-looking piece of fruit and find it full of maggot . “ It ’ s important , from a biosecurity perspective , for people to name them correctly , then they know what they ’ re deal with so they do the right thing – there be different control measure for different specie , ” say Dr Darryl Hardie , AKA Dr Bug-A-Lugs , an entomologist and consultant for Western Australia ’ s Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development . Related : Slow poison : how Queensland government worker pay the price for fruit fly eradication Australia have more than specie of fruit fly but two cause the economic destruction : the Queensland fruit fly ( Qfly ; Bactrocera tryoni ) , which appear mostly down the east coast , and the Mediterranean fruit fly ( Medfly ; Ceratitis capitata ) , find largely in WA . Hardie explain that the female attack immature fruit on the tree to lay their egg inside , which hatch into larva ( maggot ) and cause fruit rot , while vinegar fly be attract by fruit that be already rot . If you buy fruit contain the real fruit fly , you might notice a large pupa ( cocoon larva ) in the bottom of your fruit bowl or even near a skirt board , a maggot leave the fruit and pupate for about a week before they emerge a a fly . “ So you can get the economic specie , ” say Hardie , “ but they win ’ t usually reinfest anything in the bowl . They ’ ll just try to find a mate and get out. ” Vinegar fly , on the other hand , like to hang around and keep reproducing . Eradicating vinegar fly Fortunately , internet hack to get rid of the so-called fruit fly , alias vinegar fly , be largely sound . The most popular , cheap and easy method be to put about an inch of apple cider vinegar in a glass or bowl with dishwashing liquid . This be Missenden ’ s trap of choice . The fermented vinegar smell like rot fruit and attract the fly , he explain , then the detergent cause them to drown . “ Some insect can walk along water , and a drop of detergent just break the water surface so their leg don ’ t hold them up and they sink to the bottom. ” Related : ‘ Fruit bowl be out ’ : the best way to store fresh produce , accord to expert You may need to do this several time to catch one that be still at egg or larva stage – their life cycle range between seven and day . For best result , remove other ferment product such a ripe fruit , food scrap or glass contain leftover wine or beer . In short , keep your kitchen clean and dish wash . This can also help prevent them – always better than cure . Vinegar fly can get out of control very quickly . “ Often the vinegar fly seem to just spring up overnight , ” Missenden say . “ You only need a couple to create a fairly big population very quickly. ” To keep the vinegar fly away , the best hack , accord to Thanh Truong , AKA Fruit Nerd , be to store your fruit correctly . His advice , detail in the book Don ’ t Buy Fruit & amp ; Veg Without Me ! will also help to keep fruit fresher and tastier . To slow fruit ripening , he say ditch the fruit bowl . The more fruit that be stack on top of each other , the greater the buildup of gas and the faster they will ripen . You be also more likely to miss fruit that have become overripe or damage . Any fruit that be ripen should be eat or put straight in the fridge . Thick-skinned fruit such a mango be less vulnerable to vinegar fly , while thin-skinned fruit such a banana be prime target . “ Putting banana next to apple or pear be a really bad idea , ” say Truong , “ because they release so much ethylene that the banana will have half it shelf life. ” So if you can ’ t bear to part with your fruit bowl , he say half the battle be win just by store banana separately . “ Fruit be alive , and if you see it a a commodity you ’ re never go to be able to battle this , because you ’ re watch fruit a it ripen , a it ’ s change physiologically , and the insect and nature be respond in the same way . ”', 'On a walk through Sydney ’ s idyllic eastern suburb , home to pristine beach and casual affluence , Ngaiire be talk about her plan to leave this all behind . Recently , she tell me , her mother move back to their native Papua New Guinea , where the soul singer be bear and live , on and off , until the age of . “ I be very upset when Mum say they be gon na go back , ” she say “ But to be honest , we ’ re preparing to move back there by the end of the year. ” “ The biggest thing be for our son to have a different upbringing . He ’ s get a pretty privileged life here . He go to a nice private school in the eastern suburb . I want him to grow up in an area that ’ s a lot more realistic and have a bit more grit. ” Ngaiire be proud of how hard she and her Sydney-born husband have work to afford their six-year-old son , Nadav , or just “ Dovie ” , the comfort of the harbour city . But now she want to make a move that will hopefully ensure her child do not turn out to be , a she term it , a “ little arsehole ” . “ I just want it to be a bit harder for him , so he have more resilience. ” The world be change , greater global conflict loom and her son , bear to a Papua New Guinean mum and a Jewish-Australian dad , will have a lot of identity to grapple with . So that resilience , Ngaiire think , will come in handy . It ’ s a windy Wednesday afternoon when I meet Ngaiire to walk around La Perouse and talk music , family and rip up old root to replace them with new one . It ’ s an area she have come to know well , often come for fish and chip with her family or to hike the bush headland route . Her husband grow up not far from here ; the couple now live with their son a few suburb up the road . An astute tour guide , she point out local landmark like the bridge that feature in an explosion scene in Mission Impossible or the nudist beach just visible from where we ’ re walking , the horizon dot by a pair of disrobed older men . Despite her ease here , Sydney wasn ’ t Ngaiire ’ s first land place after move to Australia . First come Lismore , where the family move after her mother get a scholarship to study here . Then , at age , Ngaiire begin study jazz at the Central Queensland University and soon after embark on a career in music that have now see her release three album of graceful future soul and R & amp ; B , pick up four Aria Award nomination , become the first Papua New Guinean artist to place in the triple j Hottest and play at the Sydney Opera House back by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra – a concert that be record for her first ever live album , out now . It all begin when a lecturer at university urge Ngaiire to try out for a new television contest call Australian Idol . The first season she be unsuccessful . But on the second , she make it to the final , wow the judging panel with rendition of track like Mary J Blige ’ s No More Drama .

I get my first big gig with Paul Mac , then go on to tour with a band call Blue King Brown , and then start to do my own stuff . And three album later , we ’ re here in La Perouse. ” The Idol chapter of her life be one Ngaiire hasn ’ t speak about publicly before . Like a lot of the artist who get their start on that reality juggernaut , she ’ s previously “ make a point to not talk about it ever ” – reluctant to remind anyone of her tie to a show that can now feel a little daggy . “ I think everyone that be attach to be on one of those show struggle with that , ” she say . “ This be the first time I ’ ve be OK with talk about it and I think it just come with maturity , because why be I go to pretend that this never happen ? The life that I have now would not have happen if it wasn ’ t for that show . As corny and as cheesy a it be , man , I meet so many lifelong friend on that show . And people that I start work with , I would not have work with have they not see me on the show . “ Now I ’ m just like , it ’ s a part of my story . I ’ m not gon na deny that. ” But not everything about music come naturally to her . Ngaiire have always be a “ shy little mouse ” , who for year keep her sing talent to herself – hiding in her teenage bedroom to practise imitate Mariah Carey ’ s vocal run in private . And in our conversation , trace of that trait be still evident – Ngaiire have a humble reluctance to talk about herself , more comfortable ask me question , and open up only gradually during our hour together . That reluctance to put herself centre stage be something Ngaiire have to learn to overcome when she start play live . “ Paul Mac be very instrumental in help me get over that , ” she say . “ He ’ d always give me note at the end of our show together and say , Ngaiire , you can ’ t just scurry off stage . You have to stand there and receive your flower – and then you can go , ” she laugh . Now , older and more comfortable in herself , after release this new live record , Ngaiire plan to focus on finish off a fourth album of original material . It ’ s one that will tread some different thematic ground to what come before it . Her second album , Blastoma , reflect on her experience of have a rare type of childhood cancer , and her third tackle the pregnancy complication that almost kill her . But the next one be likely to be a little sunnier – because , in what be a very good problem to have , life for Ngaiire be pretty nice right now .

Ngaiire be excite to give Dovie a different life in the country ’ s rural highland – one where he can “ run around barefoot and climb tree and do all the thing that we use to do when we be kid that he can ’ t necessarily do here ” . “ The last time we be there , he come back with so much confidence because he felt support within community and he felt safe a well – which be an ironic thing to tell people , because when they think about Papua New Guinea , they don ’ t necessarily think that PNG be safe . But specifically in the village , child be really take care of and protected. ” In preparation for the move , Ngaiire and her husband have start build a house on a property close to a support system of aunty , uncle and cousin . Her husband , who work a a designer now , be toy with the idea of open a restaurant somewhere in the island nation . And Ngaiire have even receive funding to open her own music school in Papua New Guinea , where she want to help nurture the next generation of talent . It ’ s be a big journey , from grow up in PNG to the bright light of the music industry and , soon , return to a slower , calmer life .

Or be fundamentalist Christians take the book because they didn ’ t want them to be available ? ” The head of public library service at the State Library of New South Wales be today no closer to find an answer than he be when the thievery be at it height in the s. In any case , it be hard to know whether the book be steal or lose – and his observation , though widely hold , be anecdotal . Few , if any , library truly know how many book be actually steal . Lost library book be a small part of the natural attrition of library collection – normal wear and tear be expect and some be fatally damage . But while we ’ ve all lose a library book in our time , Morley estimate fewer than % of loaned book across NSW public library go miss . In Brisbane , where the city council oversee library and a collection of .m item , , book be consider lose or more than day past their due date . Overdue book , of which there be , , form . % of the library ’ physical collection . In Sydney ’ s Blacktown council , library make , , loan in - . The council ’ s library customer service coordinator , Samantha Cadwallen , can ’ t put a number on it , but the most “ steal ” book be the Bible , she say . Hitler ’ s Mein Kampf also have a habit of go miss , almost year after it be first publish . High school resource be in high demand ; a box of Higher School Certificate support book be recently return to a different council – none be out on loan . In general , Morley say , many science fiction book – very popular and often publish in a series format – be as rare a hen ’ s teeth . “ But whether they ’ re steal or they ’ re out ” , he ’ s not sure . After all , why steal something that ’ s free ? “ I don ’ t feel like there ’ s something similar in public library a there be with shoplift – the incentive to steal isn ’ t there because you can borrow it , ” he say . “ A certain small amount don ’ t come back and that ’ s just the way it is. ” Many libraries no longer charge for overdue item . In Brisbane , a lose book land the customer with the cost of the book plus a $ administration fee . At the time of writing , Melbourne city council ’ s most popular book be RF Kuang ’ s Yellowface and Wifedom by Anna Funder . Genre-wise , crime , romance thriller , travel , business and health nonfiction consistently top it most-borrowed list . The council have recently have a book return that be six year overdue . “ What happen ? Who know , ” say councillor Jamal Hakim , the council ’ s Creative Melbourne lead . Rather than be able to define which book go walking , he can tell Guardian Australia which be the most damage from , book borrow and , visit last financial year . “ Cookbooks always come back with food stain . You can almost smell yesterday ’ s dinner on them . Art book come back with oil and paint on their page , and you definitely always know which book be on the curriculum. ” And , puppy training book come back with “ actual teeth mark ” on their cover . “ It bring the ‘ puppy ate my homework ’ excuse to a whole new level , ” he say . Still , he ’ s happy the collection be be use , or “ live ” , a he put it . More “ sinister ” be the trend for a pushback against some sex education book aim at teen , which Morley have see grow over the last month . The title have be the subject of an organise campaign incite people around Australia to push for their exclusion from library , he say . Librarians , whose job it be to collect widely and without restriction a per commonwealth classification , be not to respond to that public pressure , he say .

The most popular factual title be Scott Pape ’ s The Barefoot Investor . Given the pressure on household budget , this chime with Hakim ’ s suggestion that the popularity of business book be down to people want to understand “ the hustle ” and how best to value their time and effort . The cost of living may also be drive a rise in visitor number to the city of Perth ’ s library , with the number increase by % this financial year , say a council spokesperson . There , DVDs go miss more than book – and lose item be not record by number but in a cumulative dollar amount , which the council do not divulge . The same change in demographic , season and socioeconomic circumstance that play their part in loan trend also influence the position library hold in community . Where they use to be a place for read material , they be now home to webcams , microphone , synthesiser , game accessory , Stem learn kit ( “ very very cool ” , say Hakim ) and tool . “ We realise a lot of people be live in small apartment , so people can borrow them and use them , ” he say .

But the term itself be far older , originate in Patrick Hamilton ’ s play Gas Light , about a man deceive his wife in order to steal from her . The Victorian melodrama have be adapt many time over the last century , most famously in the film star Ingrid Bergman and Angela Lansbury – and now a new adaptation be tour Australia , with Geraldine Hakewill and Toby Schmitz . Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads , pop culture and tip for the weekend , every Saturday morning First stag in , Canadian playwright Johnna Wright and Patty Jamieson ’ s version make some key change to the original text , include a reduction from three act to two ; composite character ; and an update on the story ’ s politics ( despite it remain set in ) . Helmed by Queensland Theatre Company ’ s artistic director Lee Lewis , Hakewill and Schmitz play Bella and Jack Manningham , a young couple rent a home in London – where the dutiful , fretful Bella begin notice thud sound in the attic and the titular gaslight dimming , which no one else can hear or see . At first Jack seem to be a loving husband , concern about his wife ’ s suppose descent into madness . Doesn ’ t she remember that she take a portrait off the wall ? Or that she hide her late mother ’ s pearl necklace ? Or that she steal a bracelet at a party ? “ Stop lying to yourself , ” he plead . “ I ’ m afraid one day I win ’ t be able to protect you. ” The audience , of course , know well – Jack be a master of coercive control and Bella his fragile puppet , for reason that become clearer to the audience , and then to Bella , over the course of the play . Maids Elizabeth ( Kate Fitzpatrick ) and Nancy ( Courtney Cavallaro ) provide comic relief – Cavallaro be especially funny a the deadpan cockney newcomer who may or may not be the object of Jack ’ s affection – but their role in Jack ’ s reign of quiet terror also play out subtly . Are they in on it ? Renée Mulder ’ s Gothic set be intricately lay out like a Victorian sitting room , with credenza , painting hang on the wall , a staircase that serve various function , and a chandelier that become a crucial , and surprising , plot point . Bella ’ s period costume be particularly lovely , from a white dress to a deep green gown – the colour become bolder a she develop her steel . Lighting designer Paul Jackson mark the passage of time through a large , curtain window , where colour change from gold to blue ; inside , the gaslight be turn on and off with a ritualistic rhythm . Paul Charlier ’ s original score lend an eerie , filmic quality – indeed , there ’ s something cinematic about the way the story play out . Unlike recent psychological thriller on stage , such a the disastrous : , this production grasp the effectiveness of silence a a tool to build unease and suspense . One scene , where all the character have leave and the room stand empty and still , be discomfit for precisely this reason . The house be a character in itself , ominous and unknowable . The push and pull between Bella and Jack be convince in the hand of the two lead actor , who work well together to tease out the intricacy of the relationship . Schmitz be wooden at first , but ease into Jack ’ s duplicitous Jekyll and Hyde act ; a climactic scene where his violence finally turn physical be genuinely horrify . Hakewill ’ s range be wonderful , a her delicate , furtive look give way to wide-eyed horror and eventually determination and rage . But in this version , Bella ’ s journey , from meek , subservient housewife to furious independent woman be less nuanced than in the original text . And by do away with Hamilton ’ s male detective who help her piece together the mystery of her life , Wright and Jamieson grant Bella more agency and intelligence : she no longer need a man to save her . Giving the character the mindset of a modern feminist make the play more empowering , and the talented Hakewill ’ s turn be thrill to watch – but her defiant speech at the end feel too contemporary for . It leave the viewer with a sense of cognitive dissonance : if you want to have it this way , why not set it in the modern day ? Hamilton ’ s prescient idea about emotional abuse remain a relevant today a ever , and this production have plenty to admire – but the script be too often on the nose , tell rather than show .

Between the two , on a bend in the road , be the place where , accord to allegation in the indictment , he be involve in set up a roadblock patrol by men wield machete and club . Manassé Musabyimana – a convict genocidaire who spend year in prison for his crime – say he be Munyaburanga ’ s student at school . His name appear on Munyaburanga ’ s indictment , list a an alleged perpetrator . He tell the Guardian/Four Corners he be stop on the road by Munyaburanga one morning in April and claim he be order to man the roadblock . The Guardian/Four Corners first encounter Musabyimana a he shuffle slowly to church at the top of the hill at Hanika . He say he be willing to speak with u , but say he be go to pray now , and he would like to talk somewhere quieter . We arrange to meet the next morning in a patch of forest , down in the valley . “ When I reach Hanika , I find Munyaburanga there together with soldier , he have establish the roadblock . There be three soldier with him … he tell me not to move on , he order me to sit down there , ” he claim . “ After establish the roadblock , they form a team of strong youth who would go on the attack , those of u who be older would remain at the roadblock . Those who have go on the attack would bring people to be kill at the roadblock. ” Those bring to the roadblock “ be kill by machete , club , they be beat to death ” , Musabyimana say . He felt he could not defy Munyaburanga : “ He be a respected man , he be a leader , my head teacher. ” Shown the indictment that allege his involvement in crime , Musabyimana say he confess before the gacaca court . He say he didn ’ t kill anybody but admit he be part of the mob that attack and kill Tutsi at the roadblock . He say he didn ’ t see Munyaburanga kill anyone . “ I admit my role [ in genocide ] and ask for forgiveness because what happen be terrible . To today , it be something that continue to hurt me … it hurt me so much. ” default Musabyimana say while he suffer every day for the crime he commit , he have accept the long decade lose in prison . But he be fire by a stubborn sense of injustice that some of those who he allege give order to kill , those with the wherewithal – the connection , the money , the influence – appear to have escape justice . “ Maybe if he do not order me to stand on that roadblock … if he do not put me there , I would not have be in prison for such a long time , ” he claim . “ It would be well if he show up to face court the same way we be punish for what we do , and to show justice to the one who lose their families. ” The list of the dead On the same indictment that list the alleged crime of Munyaburanga and Musabyimana , survivor Marie Golithi Uwisenga find the name of her murdered relative . Sitting in her low-slung bungalow , halfway up the hill at Hanika , Golithi wipe tear from her eye a she point to the name . “ My uncle … my brother … my brother … daddy , ” she say . In her garden outside the window be the mass grave that hold her relative . Munyaburanga , she claim , take a leadership role during the attack , although she do not witness him kill anyone . “ He would lead them during the attack , he be the leader of the roadblock , ” she say . “ The attack would go and search for people , bring them to the roadblock and Munyaburanga would give order of whom to kill and whom to leave . “ When they ’ d catch a person , he would command them , ‘ Take that one back , we ’ ll kill them later. ’ ” Golithi be year old at the time of the genocide . She know Munyaburanga . “ I be scar of him , ” she say . Golithi would ultimately lose member of her family in the genocide . She survive only by hide , sometimes for day at a time , in neighbour ’ house or the dense sorghum field near her house . Golithi say she be upset to learn Munyaburanga might be live freely on the other side of the world . “ It hurt me , because we don ’ t have anyone. ” Golithi ’ s cousin Chaliroti Mutegarugori say she saw Munyaburanga abduct her -year-old brother . “ I saw him with my own eye take my brother ; he even beat him a he be take him . “ They have machete and club ; there be Munyaburanga with many others … they start beat [ my brother ] , they strike him on his shoulder and the blood spill out . I be afraid and run away. ” She do not witness her brother ’ s death . Four of Mutegarugori ’ s relative be allege in the indictment a have be kill by a group of militia that include Munyaburanga . Calls for further investigation Graham Blewitt be a former director of Australia ’ s Special Investigations Unit , establish in to investigate the alleged presence of Nazi war criminal in Australia .

Blewitt argue Australia have be apathetic for decade when it come to investigate and prosecute international crime such a genocide . He tell the Guardian/Four Corners that the allegation against Munyaburanga demand further investigation . “ There seem to be eyewitness evidence a to their [ allege ] activity and formal court proceeding have take place in Rwanda , ” he say , add that if the evidence still exist , then it might be able to form the basis of a proper criminal trial in Australia . In Rwanda , the necessity for survivor and perpetrator to find a way to live together peaceably have foster – even enforce – a sense of unity and cooperation . A country so viscerally torn apart have choose – to a degree have have impose upon it by ruthless government diktat – solidarity , because it have live the horror of it opposite . Conversely in Australia , the small Rwandan diaspora remain deeply divide , rive by factionalism .

She ’ ll return to it , she say – a sense of mission seem to compel her – but relive her experience over and over be weary . Her nerve be taut a she drive home across the darken city . She be angry , she say quietly , that men accuse of involvement in the genocide – include , perhaps , from her home district in Rwanda – might be live in Australia . “ Angry , and at the same time , uncertain .

This month the Guardian report that Australian academic be among those who have collaborate on drone research with counterpart at an Iranian university . The concern among many government be that university research could be use to enhance military and surveillance technology in repressive regime . In Iran , research conduct at national university have be find to directly contribute to the country ’ s nuclear and drone program . In a report , Australia ’ s parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security express concern over research collaboration in critical technology and recommend that university “ exercise greater caution with international research partnership ” in those area . They have direct control over academic direction and research priority Rana Dadpour Daniel Roth , whose organisation United Against Nuclear Iran ( UANI ) regularly highlight academic collaboration that it deem a security risk , say Iranian university “ don ’ t operate under the same principle of academic independence that we understand ” . He say academic be “ ultimately direct by the regime and military when it come to specific area of research ” . Rana Dadpour , now a researcher on migration at James Cook University in Queensland , taught at an Iranian university for four year and saw up close how intertwine the institution be with the state . “ They have direct control over academic direction and research priority , ” she say . Some research area would be direct by Iran ’ s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) and could be use for “ surveillance or military purpose ” .

They complain about her clothes , tell her she should not wear jean , and ask her to follow the strict dress code . “ I do not accept , so they do not renew my contract . Soon after that I decide to leave the country. ” Dadpour say many academic in Australia could not conceive of the level of interference in Iranian university , because they operate so freely here . She say there be a “ knowledge gap among Australian academic on the extent of restriction in Iran , mainly because of the lack of information come out of Iran ” .

How do we get here , to the land of some of the largest average home on Earth ? And can we ever turn back the tide on big house culture ? ‘ I want one of those ’ How we get here begin , in a way , on a leafy avenue in Burwood , a suburb on the boundary of Sydney ’ s inner west . Along the short , but wide and handsome Appian Way – bisect by a grass tennis court – be stately Federation home , set back from the footpath by lush front garden . They be station apart from one another – veranda and garden and path establish clear boundary , turret and gable showcase wealth and taste – each a miniature castle build for a new world . “ / , ” say architect Tone Wheeler without hesitation . This be one of three key date the president of the Australian Architecture Association say mark Australia ’ s progress to big house culture . As federation near , local council be determine to dispense with the smaller terrace home and worker cottage of the past , the slum which have prove unsightly and problematic in the larger city . So they call for larger subdivision of land , he say . “ That ’ s where the quarter-acre [ , -sq-metre ] block come from. ” “ Appian Way become the place every homeowner go to and say ‘ I want one of those ’ , ” say Wheeler . No longer be the colony a land of crowded dirty city and a vast pastoral land beyond , scatter with a few grand home tend to by house staff . Appian Way , and the quarter-acre block divvied up across the country , become a new form of national aspiration and identity . “ Suddenly it become suburbia , detached house , individual style. ” It go from be your domestic life , your home where you raise a family , to be property and product Tone Wheeler It set the standard for the Australian dream in a country that be in the business of define it place and aspiration . The big house . The quarter-acre block . A place apart from others . It be , in truth , a dream only available to the upper middle class , but the rest of u have be chase it ever since . Wheeler next identifies , when auctioneer AV Jennings buy a plot of land in Melbourne for the purpose of build new home ( have run out of exist home to sell himself ) a a second turning point . It would ultimately prove to be the beginning of a project home behemoth – though the global economy and event would intervene to prevent that model from kick off just yet . During the height of the second world war , when battalion of the rent class be out fighting and die in foreign land , the dream of “ one little piece of earth with a house and garden which be ours ; to which we can withdraw … into which no stranger may come against our will ” be extol by the prime minister of the time , Robert Menzies . The desire to own a house of one ’ s own be , he declare , a “ noble instinct ” . After the war , new home for the ordinary person to own be finally build at mass , home ownership boom but labour and material shortage keep a natural cap on house size . That enforce modesty , however , would not last . The aspiration set by the Appian Way era , the model set by AV Jennings in the s , and the sense of righteous entitlement to home ownership set by Menzies collide in the s. This be the decade – around / – say Wheeler , when project home shift from single-storey build , to two storey . Related : Art deco density : what we learn from Australia ’ s first apartment boom “ The two-storey house be the thing that destroy the bungalow idea of single-storey Sydney and Melbourne , ” say Wheeler . “ When you have two-storey house it enable you to have a much bigger house , to separate thing out , to put child ’ s room separate from parent room . And then what do you fill these room with ? You have a parent ’ retreat , a rumpus room , now you have a cinema room , a game room , the kitchen get bigger , you get a butler ’ s pantry . “ It go from be your domestic life , your home where you raise a family , to be property and product. ” And with a product , bigger be well . The monetisation of home Our home have always be a display of our individual wealth . But over the past three decade in Australia , home have go from be a display of wealth to a vehicle for create it . “ We be now think of housing a our major investment in our life , ” say Hannah Lewi , professor of architecture at the University of Melbourne and co-director of the Australian Centre for Architectural History and Urban and Cultural Heritage . “ Once it get embroil completely with the major financial equation in someone ’ s life , then maximise become the main objective. ” As a home have become something more than shelter and into a speculative investment , say Wheeler , the way we think about that space become “ skew ” . “ People think , ” he say , “ ‘ We could do with a house that ’ s sq metre , but when time come to sell we want to be much bigger , so we ’ ll build a sq metre , so it ’ ll be worth more money – even if we don ’ t need it. ’ ” ( In - , the ABS find that % of household in Australia have at least one bedroom spare ) . Interactive “ Almost everyone we ’ ve ever meet [ a architect ] be interested in the value of their property go up. ” The fact that any gain in value on the home you reside in be not subject to tax and be not include in mean test for the age pension , say Hal Pawson , professor of housing research and policy and associate director at UNSW ’ s City Futures Research Centre , mean it make financial sense for those who own home to build bigger and bigger to get the greatest tax-free benefit . Often , debate about McMansions be ting with condescension ; the bourgeois inner city wring it hand at the unsophisticated aspiration of those in the new outer suburb . However , the expansion of exist home in these establish area be an important part of the explosion of our national house footprint over the past to year , say Pawson . Modest bungalow knock down and replace with hulk two-storey home , semi gutted and rebuild to double in size . Inner suburban streetscapes forever dot with council approval sign cable-tied to front gate , alert neighbour to renovation afoot . “ It isn ’ t just the outer suburb , ” say Pawson . “ The cultural preference [ for larger home ] be a pretty widely share one. ” ‘ Everyone have to have their own space ’ Aside from the evolution of home from place of domestic life to vehicle for financial gain , something else have happen to the way we think about space in our home . As I sit in my home and imagine , a I sometimes do , where the nine White child may have fit , it become quite clear that they do not . That much of their life must have be spend in public place – along the street , in the local park , perhaps down at the municipal pool – and that time spend within the home would have involve little privacy and limited individual possession . “ There seem to be a shift in the way social dynamic work in family , ” say Lewi . “ Everyone have to have their own space . They must have privacy . And that seem to have to happen at an earlier age. ” Related : Look around you . The way we live explains why we be increasingly polarize Alongside the shift within family dynamic , some have liken modern suburbia to place of miniature fortress , where unscheduled interaction with others – neighbour and stranger alike – be limit by the retreat into our ever-larger home . “ All the thing that be the glue of the suburb – pool , bowl club , civic centre , cinema , baby centre – gradually a lot of that public realm interaction have fall away , ” say Lewi . “ More and more thing be atomise into people ’ s home . Homes have to do multi-functional things. ” Wheeler say the desire to have more of one ’ s own private space increase a one ’ s wealth do , but “ Australians have put that on steroids. ” The idea of what child , family or any household need be always inform by what we see around u . Which be why what be acceptable in one era be unthinkable a few decade later , and why in Finland people seem no less happy with their house le than half the size of Australian one . A American study find that people ’ s satisfaction with their home do generally rise with more space , but only until the house in their neighbourhood get bigger . When the NSW government this year announce plan to increase density in Sydney , the premier , Chris Minns , remark that the city be the th most expensive in the world , but the th most dense . Indeed , Australian city be notoriously some of the world ’ s most expensive but not , say Pawson , when we compare how much we get for the money . A study by the Urban Land Institute find that , when consider cost per square metre of new and exist home , Sydney , Melbourne and Brisbane home be cheaper than those in Shanghai , Beijing , Guangzhou , Hangzhou , Tokyo , Yokohama-shi , Osaka-shi , Singapore and Seoul . Interactive “ What that ’ s say be that we have cultural preference for large property and we , to some extent , pay the price for that , ” he say . * * * I would like a bigger house I wonder , often , about how much space be in the roof . Can we build an extra bedroom up there ? Maybe an en suite bathroom ? Could we open up the third bedroom and make a big open live space ? Maybe we can squeeze a tiny studio in the garden . Because while this be enough for now , we be constantly think : how will this work when the child be grow ? Half of all -- year-olds live in their parental home . The housing affordability crisis have create it own ouroboros – the homeowner ’ s impetus to make their house as expensive a possible effectively price out the child who have grow up in these house from afford their own . And so house now may need to be bigger to accommodate the greater number of larger body that inhabit them . “ The need for separation be greater when you ’ ve get semi-autonomous young adult live under the same roof a their parent , ” say Pawson . “ Older teenager and adult be not leave home , ” say Lewi . “ People who might have downsize at a younger age be now feel like they have to support their adult child , so they need larger houses. ” Lewi have two son , and . “ They ’ re both living at home and will never leave . One of them live in a cabin in the garden , ” she laugh . The cabin be originally design to be a home office , and place for guest . Separate living quarter , like cabin , real estate agent have tell her , be now a huge selling point . Related : Up to , house be empty in Australia – find out where they be Is there a way back from big house culture ? Lewi suggest that large house that be far away from facility be “ really bad for age population ” . Wheeler imagine that large home with long commute from the city may become “ stranded asset ” . A shift to denser , smaller living be firstly and mostly a financial necessity for many , he argue , not a cultural or philosophical rejection of expansive private domain . “ The market will dictate , ” he say . “ People be live in apartment , explore more densification , through necessity , ” say Lewi . “ And they ’ re finding , perhaps , that ’ s bring them more community. ” “ We be move away – maybe quite slowly – from the suburban home ownership dream , ” say Pawson . After decade of ever-expanding house , we may have reach a kind of breakpoint . Where for a new generation , the Australian promise of a big house , the myth of the quarter-acre block have move so far away on the horizon , they see it not a a dream , but a mirage .

The Stones be just one of many momentous Enmore theatre gig . To others , it might be the place Bob Dylan play a similarly hard-to-believe show in . Some will remember it a the place where the prime minister , Anthony Albanese , at the time newly elect , skolled a beer to wild applause at a Gang of Youths show , or the venue where Four Tet set up DJ deck in the middle of the floor and charge punter just $ to come dance . Perhaps you be there the night in when Ween fan drink the venue entirely clean of beer , or have fond teenage memory of camp out on Enmore Road to buy ticket from the box office in the pre-internet age . Maybe you loiter around the back of the venue to give Courtney Love and Melissa Auf der Maur friendship bracelet you make after a Hole show in the s. Of course , it ’ s not just what ’ s happen within the Enmore ’ s wall but the venue itself that make it a beloved Sydney venue . Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads , pop culture and tip for the weekend , every Saturday morning “ It ’ s get a certain gravitas , ” say David James Young , a dedicated gig goer who be currently in the official process of authenticate his Guinness World Record submission for most concert attend in one year . He saw gig in , and estimate he ’ s be to between and show at the Enmore over his adult life . “ [ There ’ s ] a majesty to walk in that room – it really feel like a hallow hall because it have remain largely unchanged for the -odd years. ” The heritage isn ’ t all that make it a preferred venue for many Sydney music fan . Rather than be sequester away in Olympic Park or set in the sanitary confines of the CBD or Entertainment Quarter , it ’ s in a vibrant , accessible stretch of inner Sydney . And then there ’ s the capacity that ’ s big enough to house noteworthy act , but not so large it start to feel like you ’ re up in the nosebleed section , lend it a feeling that Young describe a “ simultaneously massive and intimate ” . ( A hot tip : have see gig there from “ every possible position ” , he rate be on the floor about to row of people back a the best vantage point . ) While the Enmore have be there for more than year , live music wasn ’ t always on the lineup . It be originally open in a an open-air cinema , enclose four year later , and later sell to Hoyts in , who undertake a large-scale renovation of the venue and transform it into the art deco marvel it be today . It remain a theatre until the s – by that time have go from Hoyts ’ best-performing cinema to a derelict purveyor of foreign film – when the Eliades family in Sydney buy it in and slowly build it into the concert space it be today . By the mid-s , the venue have start come into it own , but get there take a lot of “ blood , sweat and tear ” , Khoury say . “ It always use to be a second option – a B-grade option – to the play in the [ suburb ] . That start to reverse. ” While the venue have already be “ busy ” before Mick Jagger come to visit , that fateful gig in mark a turning point for the Enmore . “ The Rolling Stones be certainly a cornerstone event , ” say Khoury . “ It make people realise that the theatre be … a vibrant , viable music venue. ” That Rolling Stones gig also kickstarted a trend of other stadium-filling band choose to instead play the Enmore . In , Coldplay follow suit , pick the venue a the site of their only Australian show while promote their album Ghost Stories – a big step down after have play to , people on their previous tour of the country . ( They use the same trip to film the video for A Sky Full of Stars walk down the adjacent King Street , Newtown . ) “ I ’ ve never be ask for more [ free ticket ] in my life a I be for the Coldplay show , ” laugh Khira Holloway , head of event delivery at Century Venues . Then in , look to establish himself a a rock star , not a pop star – a considerable rebrand give his past in One Direction – a newly solo Harry Styles play the theatre . Fervent fan ( and their dutiful dad ) camp out for three night in advance to get a spot a close to the stage a possible , BYO-ing fold-out chair , sleep bag and portable phone charger . Styles inspire a level of fervour perhaps not match again until , when the Enmore nab the first Sydney show from Fred Again . Eager fan try anything and everything to get into the very much sold-out gig , amid the nationwide mania that accompany the UK producer ’ s tour . “ Someone walk up and hand our box office staff $ , in cash and say , ‘ I need to get in ’ and [ he ] turn him away , ” Stabback recall . “ He ’ s still work for u , a you can imagine. ” And then there ’ s the act the Enmore manage to snag a they be right on the precipice of blow up . In , both Lana Del Rey and Kendrick Lamar play the theatre – each returning to play Qudos Bank Arena on their next Australian tour . Even Katy Perry hold a show there in . “ I be usher on that shift , ” Stabback recall . “ She do this amazing bit where she pull out an inflatable giant cherry chapstick and ride it across the crowd. ” Of course , it hasn ’ t all be smooth sailing . When Covid hit – “ an awful time , ” say Stabback – the venue shutter for a year . But that enforce downtime give the Enmore a chance to embark on long-planned renovation , fast-tracking restoration work they ’ d plan to initially do “ in piecemeal , like keyhole surgery ” . It be initially a rocky path after lockdown ease , but then come the bounceback . “ Since , it ’ s be a landslide of show , it ’ s just non-stop . be probably one of our busiest year on record , ” Stabback say . “ It ’ s interesting , because we ’ re come into a cost-of-living crisis , but we be still wait for that tip point … I think it say something about the value of live entertainment to people – you ’ ll sell your car , but you ’ re still go to go to a concert. ” And then there be the night a Genesis Owusu gig break the floor . Or , rather : “ We ’ re say it subside . It didn ’ t break , ” Stabback say . The show happen in the midst of a particular soggy stretch of La Niña in . A period of intensely torrential rain have create a waterlog under the floor and a Owusu bust out his fiery , propulsive track The Other Black Dog and the crowd begin to cut loose , a section of the dancefloor buckle . Young be there the night of the show . “ I notice a bunch of people have fall over and I assume it be just … the hustle and bustle of the mosh , ” he remember . “ It be only when they all stand up and be all suddenly shorter than they previously be that I realise what have happen . A kind of sea have part next to me and I be able to get a look at the floor , and I saw the sink … But we be all just kind of look at one another be like , what just happen ? ” Miraculously , no one be hurt . Perhaps even more miraculously , the venue be back open and run the next night , with a make-up Genesis Owusu gig schedule for the following week . “ Twenty minute after the show we have a crew of engineer and builder underneath that floor and work on that to get that back up , ” say Stabback . “ The show must go on. ” This be the first in a new series turn the spotlight on the best live music venue around Australia .

Another feature be the key role play by Victoria in help to keep the light on – even with it own challenge ( recall the power line go down and AGL ’ s Loy Yang A plant be force to shut down ) . Queensland ’ s maximum daily demand break it previous record three time during the quarter – hence the state not be a net-exporter for a change , and the jump in wholesale price .

Several measure in this budget aim to tackle the nation ’ s worsen road death toll , with spending on the Roads to Recovery and Black Spot program to progressively increase to $ bn and $ m respectively by - . The safer local road and infrastructure program , to address heavy vehicle road safety and bridge renewal , will also receive $ m in fund each year until - . The government have also announce it will spend $ .m over six year to improve data collation of road safety incident across state to form a National Roads Safety data hub . A one-year national road safety education and awareness campaign will also be fund to the tune of $ .m . Meanwhile , the government will spend billion on new road in western Sydney , as well a on exist key road project across the country , include Melbourne ’ s North East Link . It will also spend hundred of million upgrade road in the Northern Territory , as well a key highway in all state and territory . Disorganised traveller The frantic rush to the post office to renew a passport in the lead up to an overseas holiday appear to be on the rise , and the government have figure out a new way to help this disorganised type of traveller while boost it budget . Fast track processing of passport will become an option from July . For an additional fee of $ , you can have your passport process in just five business day . The government expect to make $ .m from this express passport option over five year , with the money to be direct to support the work of the department of foreign affair and trade , so if the tourist who didn ’ t check their passport expiry date also didn ’ t check visa rule in a foreign country and find themselves detain , they ’ ll likely benefit from the consular service their speedy passport fee have fund . Related : The complete Australian budget : choose the news coverage that matter to you It ’ s important to note , the government already offer a “ priority processing ” option which cost $ for a two-day turnaround , but only certain people can pay for this option . Anyone who have lose their passport twice in the past five year be ineligible . So this new “ fast track ” option to pay $ extra for a five-day turnaround serve a a middle ground for those who may be ineligible for the faster option or don ’ t want to pay more than $ , but who can not risk wait week in the standard passport application process . Those with student debt Gaining significant attention when announce in the lead up to the budget , the government be cap indexation of student loan to either the consumer price index or the wage price index , whichever be lower . Cutting around $ bn in student debt through the change to the Hecs and Help loan program , the initiative will be backdate to mid- , reverse last year ’ s horror . % indexation hike and provide a $ , save for the average person with student debt . Freight rail operator After year of wild weather include flood destroy section of regional train track and balloon freight rail delivery time by force roundabout diversion , the Australian Rail Track Corporation ( ARTC ) , which manage large chunk of the track rely on by the nation ’ s freight rail operator , be set for reliability improvement . In an effort to remove truck from road and push freight on to rail , the ARTC will receive $ m to upgrade key section of track to make send freight by rail more reliable , include in regional Victoria and Western Australia . LOSERS Renters on average income and aspire homeowner The government have acknowledge the country be in the grip of a housing crisis , with average rent consistently rise , property ownership increasingly out of reach for worker and housing construction fall well short of national and state target . However there be little in this budget that will bring immediate relief , or even cause for short to medium term optimism , for middle and high income renter . For those renter eager to escape the constant fear of rent rise and buy their first home , there be no structural change such a to negative gearing rule that would shake up the ownership dynamic of the housing market . Related : From gen Z to Boomers : what the budget mean for your generation And while the government be continue billion in investment in home construction initiatives with the state , these be only expect to begin to significantly boost housing stock towards the end of the decade . The lack of any significant near future solution in this budget mean most renter and aspire homeowner will continue bear the brunt of the housing crisis . Tax dodgers Cracking down on multinationals , large public and private company and high-wealth individual will be the focus of the tax office ’ s Tax Avoidance taskforce , which be be extend by a further two year , until July . Extending the taskforce will cost the government $ .bn over the next five year , but will raise tax revenue by $ .bn . And while they haven ’ t exactly be cheat the system , foreign resident in Australia will be subject to a stronger capital gain tax regime more in line with what Australian resident pay , affect the tax they pay when sell property and share . The government expect to raise $ m in tax from these change over the next five year , and will spend $ m on the change . Fraudsters The government will spend $ .m over the next four year to combat scam and online fraud , with the government to legislate a Scams Code Framework which will include mandatory code for different industry . Telecommunications , bank and digital platform such a social medium and search engine will be target initially , with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) , the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ) , and the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) to receive $ .m over the four year to administer and enforce the code so that business in various industry address scam on their platform and service . The Australian Taxation Office ( ATO ) will also receive $ .m over four year to operate a secure eInvoicing network , while the ACCC will receive $ .m this come financial year to improve public awareness of scam and help the public avoid and report them . NDIS recipient and provider The government ’ s headline surplus have be achieve in part through a significant saving on the National Disability Insurance Scheme , with spending on the program predict to be $ bn le over four year than project in the mid year economic and fiscal outlook . The government will also spend about $ m over two year to boost fraud detection capability at the National Disability Insurance Agency , a it look to strengthen the integrity of the NDIS and weed out what have be a grow trend of provider game the scheme . International student A cap on the number of international student at Australian university be announce in the lead up to the budget , with the sector voice it concern at lower revenue from the high-fee pay cohort traditionally see a a cash cow to subsidise the cost for local student . In the budget , the government have reveal it plan to regulate the cap base on how much student accommodation a university build . In an acknowledgment of the added burden international student place on the already strain supply of housing for young Australians , the government will require any increase in international student enrolment to be tie to the amount of new housing a university build . “ If university want to take more international student , they must build more student accommodation , ” Chalmers say in his speech on Tuesday night .', 'More than a year after the demise of REDcycle , Coles and Woolworths customer be still incorrectly be tell they can return soft plastic food packaging to store , where they will be handle by the now-defunct recycling program . So what ’ s go on ? What be soft plastic ? Simply put , they ’ re plastic that can be scrunch into a ball . The term cover bread and cereal packet , vegetable packaging , chocolate bar wrapper and clingfilm . Australians use bn piece – or about , tonne – of soft plastic each year , accord to the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation ( Apco ) . What be REDcycle ? Formed in , REDcycle be a national soft plastic collection and recycle program . It operate across , Coles and Woolworths supermarket and some Aldi store , with customer able to drop off used soft plastic for processing . Related : Soft plastic , not fantastic : what to do with Australia ’ s bread bag and chip packet Before it collapse in November , the program claim to collect m item a day . Prior to , most of those be send to China . After that , some be mechanically recycle into road surfacing , bollard , bench and path in Australia . But a mid- fire at Close the Loop ’ s Melbourne plant – where soft plastic be turn into an asphalt additive – take away a key recycle pathway . The fire be largely blame for REDcycle ’ s suspension along with a “ downturn in market demand ” exacerbate by the Covid pandemic . Coles and Woolworths say in April that REDcycle have be stockpile soft plastic without their knowledge while the scheme itself claim it have be hold on to the waste while try to ride out problem . Sign up for Guardian Australia ’ s free morning and afternoon email newsletter for your daily news roundup What happen next ? The discovery of , tonne of stockpiled soft plastic at storage location across the country lead to the establishment of the Soft Plastics Taskforce under the aegis of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and chair by the Department of Climate Change , Energy , the Environment and Water . Its member – Coles , Woolworths and Aldi – be task with ensure the rubbish would not reach landfill . In March , the taskforce release a plan title the roadmap to restart , which detail a phased restart of soft plastic collection in store from the end of the year . That deadline be not meet . The taskforce have , however , “ consolidate and safeguard ” REDcycle ’ s stockpile and will run a small-scale soft plastic trial collection in the coming month . Just tonne have be recycle . Why do some packaging still come with the REDcycle logo ? Today , Coles shopper can still see the REDcycle logo and read about the scheme on the back of many own-brand product , include brussels sprout and corn cobbettes . Woolworths customer be advise to return some own-brand packaging to store . Brands include Uncle Tobys , Kellogg ’ s and Cadbury continue to carry the REDcycle symbol on their packaging . Both supermarket tell Guardian Australia the incorrect labelling be due to a desire to avoid add to landfill . “ Packaging be often print in bulk and use across product for month or year , so we ’ re run down exist stock before we update the recycle label to ensure we don ’ t create unnecessary waste , ” a Woolworths spokesperson say . The supermarket also display in-store message inform customer that REDcycle be no longer operating . Are supermarkets allow to provide incorrect label ? At the moment there isn ’ t an independent authority that actively assess recycle label on packaging to ensure accuracy , an Apco spokesperson say . But Jeff Angel of the Boomerang Alliance environmental group say : “ The current label be too close to greenwash and too far away from independent tracking and verification processes. ” What will the REDcycle logo be replace with ? Related : Reduce , reuse , refuse : tip to cut down plastic use in your kitchen Customers will begin to see a “ check locally ” Australasian Recycling Label on their grocery , Woolworths say . But ask household to check for local recycling option create too high a barrier , say Angel , who believe the “ industry have to be responsible , not just stick a label on it and say ‘ it ’ s up to you , customer ’ . ” New detail on reform to the regulation of packaging at federal and state level be expect in May . Angel hop the regulation will contain “ no escape clauses ” . How can consumer recycle soft plastic now ? Generally , they can ’ t . Most of Australia ’ s -odd material recovery facility , where rubbish be sort for recycle , do not have the physical ability to handle soft plastic , which be often highly contaminate by food and made of multiple material . A trial kerbside collection scheme have be under way in some council in New South Wales , Victoria and South Australia , while Randwick , Hornsby and Bendigo resident can drop off soft plastic at recycle centre . Mosman , Central Coast , Newcastle and Tamworth councils all collect soft plastic via the Curby program . How be soft plastic recycle ? Options be limit . Close the Loop ’ s new Reservoir plant in Victoria launch on Wednesday and will use more than , tonne of soft plastic a year to manufacture it asphalt additive . Other mechanical recovery company include Polyrok , Replas , Plastic Forests and SaveBoard . A prototype KitKat wrapper , trialled on NSW ’ s Central Coast in , be make with % recycled soft plastic from Licella , which convert post-consumer plastic to oil that can then be use to create food-grade plastic . Licella be yet to work at scale in Australia . Chemical recycling option be not yet mature , while fungi , algae , black fly larva and even edible plastic might one day help eliminate plastic waste . A fundamental problem with the recycle model be the small end market for expensive but low-grade recycled plastic . So long a the cost of virgin plastic be peg to the low ( and fall ) cost of oil , why buy recycle ? So what else can councils do with our soft plastic ? Waste-to-energy treatment – burn plastic to salvage energy from their otherwise low-quality bulk – have be online for decade in Europe and be in development in Australia . Otherwise , it go to rubbish dump – where % of our soft plastic currently end up . “ Plastics be inert and as long a they don ’ t leach chemical into the groundwater , landfill be potentially a better place for them to go than use very energy-intensive process , ” say Dr Ben Madden , a senior research consultant at the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney . But there must be a well alternative ? We could use less plastic . Australia ’ s supermarket sector , which be value at almost $ bn , have the power to drive innovation and push for non-plastic packaging , say Dr Tillmann Boehme , a circular economist at the University of Wollongong business school . “ Supermarkets be one of the most powerful player in the supply chain , ” he say . “ They can have a lot more influence over manufacturer . They should lead , not be the last. ” What be Australia ’ s recycle goal ? Related : Australia ’ s plan to phase out expand polystyrene packaging be fail and be never possible , industry say The Australian Food and Grocery Council ’ s national plastic recycle scheme will see food and grocery manufacturer pay a levy towards recycle the soft plastic they create . The government and industry ’ s voluntary national packaging target aim for % reusable , recyclable or compostable packaging , % of plastic packaging to be recycle or compost , % recycled content in packaging and the phase-out of single-use plastic . The all-government national waste policy action plan be aim for an % reduction of material go to landfill by and to phase out problematic and unnecessary plastic by . Sounds ambitious Packaging target will almost certainly not be meet . State , federal and local government need to leap from a combined recycle rate of m tonne to m tonne in six year to meet the target of an % reduction of material go to landfill . There be no way that can be achieve without new or increased levy , subsidy , grant , mandate or ban , say Mike Ritchie , the manage director of MRA Consulting Group . How much would it cost to fix the problem ? REDcycle ’ s budget be too small , with Coles and Woolworths pay a combined $ m to the scheme over the past decade . In July , the Albanese government announce a $ m boost for soft plastic recycle , part of a $ m commitment to the recycle modernisation fund . Angel estimate address the problem will cost ten of million of dollar a year . Other expert estimate that create collection capacity could cost $ m plus $ m a year in operating cost . But that doesn ’ t cover the recycle to follow . Who be responsible for our plastic problem ? “ No one take on responsibility for plastic , ” say Boehme . Federal , state and local government all weigh in as do industry , consumer and environmental group , but “ there be no ownership – it be a mess ” . Does recycle soft plastic make a difference ? Yes . But even if government be successful in collect and process all soft plastic , it would divert only % of total plastic from landfill , expert say . So that bigger issue need to be address , too . To put thing in perspective , REDcycle collect le than % of the soft plastic use by Australians each year . “ We need to focus on the big waste stream and big solution , ” Ritchie say . • This article be amend on January to remove an incorrect reference to “ thermonuclear ” treatment of soft plastic .'])"

    "There are some important parameters that heavily affect the performance of the CountVectorizer:\n",
    "- max_df sets the maximum document frequency. This parameter will ignore words that appear in too many documents. Having the `max_df from 0.8 and above` will results in too many unnecessary words, such as the word \"morning\", which appear in almost every article because they all contain the phrase \"Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletter\". Another reason for not setting the max_df too high is because of my choice of machine learning technique, which is LDA. The discussion why and how this technique is beneficial for this analysis will be mentioned later in this report. The aim of LDA is to find topics a document belongs to, based on how similar its bag of words to the topic. If the max_df is set too high, the top features of most articles will be too similar to each others, which reduce the effectiveness of this topic modelling technique. On the other hand, having the max_df too low will exclude some important information that can bring very good insights to the report. For example,` max_df = 0.6` will wrongly remove the word \"government\" while announcements from the government is an important factor when it comes to preserving the Indigenous culture. As a result, I set the `max_df at 0.7` because this is a reasonable level of frequency that provide valuable words to the report.\n",
    "- Similarly, the `min_df = 2` ignores the terms that appear in less than 2 documents. Setting the min_df too low will result in too many unnecessary words that will be analysed while having min_df too high will remove important distinguishing factors of each article. "

    "In order to know what are the popular topic relating to Indigenous Australians, I created the `total_count` array that get the sum of every time a term appear in a document. The result of this an array without the features' names. Therefore, for better understanding of these frequencies, I combined the feature names with their corresponding frequencies using `dict(zip)` function. One thing I learnt from my other unit named \"Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing\" is that since a Python dictionary cannot be sorted, the whole idea of the `sorted()` function is to get a representation of a dictionary that is sorted. The key parameter specifies the `lambda function` that extracts the sorting key from each item. `Item: item[1]` selects the second element of each tuple (the count). The reverse=True parameter sorts the items from highest count to lowest count."

    "- In the articles, the word <b>people</b> is used when refering to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander as a whole, and also different \"tribes\" within this group, such as Gooniyandi people, Tjupan people, Dja Wurrung people, etc. It highlights that while the community can be referred as \"Indigeous Australians\" as a whole, this is a multicultural community that every idividual groups should be respected and recognised.\n",
    "- As mentioned above, frequency of the word <b>government</b> indicates the significant role of governmental and political views in the Indigeous subject, especially in closing the cultural gap and build trust between communities and governments, as reported by the [Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet](https://www.niaa.gov.au/sites/default/files/reports/closing-the-gap-2017/executive-summary.html). Once again, this reflects the necessity of understanding and improving the impact of Advance Queensland programs to this cohort.\n",

    "We can view the articles under each topics by again using `argmax()` to get the most relevant topic of each article. For example, I am interested to see the result of the most popular topic, I will refer to the doc_per_topic_df which is already sorted by the number of articles it contains. Some articles indicated that some popular Indigenous culture and art experiences are about tour, food, community. There are some specific experienced that people talked about, such as tree-hugging and camping. Other articles suggested the leasure activities that people are interested in, such as portrait painting, sound healing, going for music shows, etc. These insights gave some very good recommendation to bringing Indigenous cultures to meet the exploration needs of people nowadays and make them a commercialise opportunity while still preserving the integrity of this ancient art form."

    "The purpose of this report is to further address some important questions about the Queensland funding situation, specifically to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What do the current funds for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders look like?\n",
    "There are a few programs that are indicated to be for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander PhD Scholarships, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Research Fellowships, Deadly Data, Deadly Innovation, Yarrabah Business Accelerator Incubation Hub. The amount of funds offered to this cohort is significantly lower than other groups due to the small number of Indigenous businesses and start-ups in the market. Some programs have been significantly boosting the commercialization of Indigenous culture and bringing about a more stable income source for many Aboriginal artists and their families, improving their living conditions and allowing them to pursue their craft full-time.\n",
    "2. What are the aspects of the Aboriginal being discussed?\n",
    "People, government and women are the most discussed phrases when searching for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander topic. These phrases indicate what aspects are important to the Indigenous community and the necessity of the government recognising different local Indigenous communities, rather than treating them as a whole. \n",
    "3. Are there any commercialisation opportunities for Indigenous art and culture?\n",
    "From the topic modelling, it was identified that some special Indigenous traditions can be interesting to visitors, such as tree-hugging traditions, art, food, and festival experiences. The topic modelling also indicated the need for healing activities with art, sounds, light, etc. Further research into these topics can be beneficial for Queensland to create an amazing experience for tourists coming to Brisbane to enjoy the Olympic games and explore the uniqueness of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and tradition.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>How should the Queensland government design better programs for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cohort?</b>  \n",
    "From the analysis of the Advance Queensland dataset and further exploring unstructured data from Guardian API, it is suggested that the government can turn their focus on individual ethnic groups within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community to identify different cultures and traditions that can be turned into a tourism opportunity. Further research into the needs of tourists nowadays can be beneficial to the planning and preparation in order to ensure the best experiences for travellers to Brisbane, especially in 2032, which is the peak economic opportunity for Queensland."

    "- First of all, the Advance Queensland dataset provides limited information about the recipients' ethnicity. Therefore, the analysis only captured the programs that were designed for the Indigenous cohort without taking into account invidudual projects run by Indigenous people or bring benefits to the Indigenous community.\n",
    "- Secondly, the LDA model is not sufficient to indicate the public's opinion on the Indigenous subject, while this information can be beneficial to decision-makers. "
